Unlike brains, these RNNs\ndo not exhibit anatomical modularity , in which functional clustering is correlated\nwith strong recurrent coupling and spatial localization of functional clusters. Con-\ntrasting with functional modularity, which can be ephemerally dependent on the\ninput [ 2], anatomically modular networks form a robust substrate for solving the\nsame subtasks in the future. To examine whether it is possible to grow brain-like\nanatomical modularity, we apply a recent machine learning method, brain-inspired\nmodular training (BIMT), to a network being trained to solve a set of composi-\ntional cognitive tasks. We find that functional and anatomical clustering emerge\ntogether, such that functionally similar neurons also become spatially localized and\ninterconnected. Moreover, compared to standard L1or no regularization settings,\nthe model exhibits superior performance by optimally balancing task performance\nand network sparsity. In addition to achieving brain-like organization in RNNs, our\nfindings also suggest that BIMT holds promise for applications in neuromorphic\ncomputing and enhancing the interpretability of neural network architectures.\n1 Introduction\nA powerful way for networks to generalize is through modularity: If seen and unseen tasks in the\nworld consist of combinations of subtasks, then a new task can be quickly solved by decomposing\nit into the set of previously seen subtasks, and tackling those based on prior learning. Recent work\nshows that RNNs trained on a set of tasks drawn by combining subtasks from a common dictionary\nbegin to exhibit functional modularity, with similar activity profiles across neurons responding to\nthe same subtask. However, the formed clusters were not anatomical. Anatomical clustering with\nlocalization of function is a central feature of brains [ 3]: for example, visual processing for object\nrecognition is localized to the ventral visual pathway while the initiation of voluntary movements\nis confined to a few motor and premotor cortical regions. Anatomical modularization can facilitate\ncontinual learning: if it takes the form of spatial localization, then new inputs can be easily routed to\nthe module; if it takes the form of recurrent connectivity, it provides lasting substructures for solving\nspecific computations on future tasks. By contrast, functional clustering alone can be ephemeral,\nwith groupings that might be defined primarily by correlations in the inputs [ 2]. When the input\ncorrelations change, functional modules could disappear.\n\u2217Equal contribution\nPreprint.

In both cases, the Pareto frontier of BIMT is better than that of L1regularization and no\nregularization.\nRecently, the method of brain-inspired modular training (BIMT) was proposed as a way to make\nartificial neural networks modular and more interpretable [ 4]. The key idea of BIMT is to encourage\nlocal neural connections via two optimization terms: distance-dependent weight regularization and\ndiscrete neuron swapping. Here we ask whether BIMT can answer a fundamental question about\nneuroscience: Can spatial constraints and wiring costs [ 5\u20137] together lead to the emergence of\nanatomical modules that are also functionally distinct?\nWe study how BIMT can lead to the emergence of spatial modules in a multitask learning setting\nrelevant to cognitive systems neuroscience with two sets of combinatorially constructed tasks,\n20-Cog-tasks [1] and Mod-Cog-tasks [2]. We train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on these\ntasks with BIMT in the supervised setup. We observe brain-like spatial organization emerging in the\nhidden layer of the RNN: neurons that are functionally similar are also localized in space (Figure 1c).\nSuch locality and sparsity are gained with no sacrifice in performance, or even accompanied by\nan improvement in performance. We introduce our methods in Section 2, and present results in\nSection 3. Due to limited space, the main paper focus on 20-Cog-tasks [1] and leave the results for\nMod-Cog-tasks [2] in Appendix B.\n2 Method\nBrain-inspired modular training (BIMT) Biological neural networks (e.g., brains) differ from\nartificial ones in that biological ones restrain neuronal connections to be local in space, leading to\nanatomical modularity. Motivated by this observation, [ 4] proposed brain-inspired modular training\n(BIMT) to facilitate modularity and interpretability of artificial neural networks. The idea is to embed\nneurons into a geometric space and minimize the total connection cost by adding the connection\n2cost as a penalty to the loss function and swapping neurons if necessary. On a number of math and\nmachine learning datasets, they show that BIMT is able to put functionally relevant neurons close\nto each other in space, just like brains. It is thus natural to ask: Can BIMT give something back to\nneuroscience? In this work, we apply BIMT to recurrent neural networks (RNN) for cognitive tasks,\nand show that the neurons in the hidden layer are organized into modules which are both anatomically\nand functionally distinct, just like brains.\nRNN We take a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) in the context of systems neuroscience,\nwhich is defined by\nht+1=\u03d5(Wht+Winut+bh),\not+1=Woutht+1+bo,(1)\nwhere ut\u2208Rnu,ht\u2208Rnh\u00d7nh,ot\u2208Rno,W\u2208Rnh\u00d7nh\u00d7Rnh\u00d7nh. We place nh\u00d7nhhidden\nneurons uniformly on a 2D grid [0,1]2(see Figure 1a), so the ijneuron (the neuron in the ithrow\nand the jthcolumn) is located at (i/nh, j/n h). The L1distance between the ijneuron and the mn\nneuron is thus Dij,mn\u2261(|i\u2212m|+|j\u2212n|)/nh2. We define the RNN\u2019s connection cost as\n\u2113cc=\u2225W\u22251+\u2225Win\u22251+\u2225Wout\u22251+|bh|1+|bo|1| {z }\nvanilla L1regularization+ A\u2225D\u2299W\u22251|{z}\ndistance-aware regularization, (2)\nwhere \u2225M\u22251\u2261P\nij|Mij|and|v|1\u2261P\ni|vi|are matrix and vector L1-norm, respectively. Ais a\nhyper-parameter controling the strength of locality constraint.\nCognitive tasks The20-Cog-tasks are a set of simple cognitive tasks inspired by experiments with\nrodents and non-human primates performed by systems neuroscientists [ 1]. These tasks are designed\nto fall into families where each family is defined by a set of computations drawn from a common\npool of computational primitives. Thus, the tasks have shared subtasks and an optimal solution is\nto form clusters of neurons specialized to these subtasks and share them across tasks, illustrated in\nFigure 2a. In our experiments, we set both input rings to have 16 dimensions, so input dimension\nnu= 16\u00d72 + 20 + 1 = 53 (where 20 for the one-hot length-20 task vector, and 1 for fixation).\nHidden neurons are aranged as 20\u00d720grid ( nh= 20 ), and output dimension no= 16 + 1 = 17 .\nThe prediction loss \u2113predis the cross-entropy between the ground truth and the predicted reaction.\nBIMT loss simply combines the prediction loss and the connection cost, i.e., the total loss function is\n\u2113=\u2113pred+\u03bb\u2113cc, (3)\nwhere \u03bb\u22650is the strength of penalizing connection costs. When \u03bb= 0, it boils down to train a\nfully-connected RNN without sparsity constraint; when \u03bb >0butA= 0, it boils down to train with\nvanilla L1regularization. Besides adding connection costs as regularization, BIMT allows swapping\nneurons to further reduce \u2113ccby avoiding local minima, e.g., if a neural network is initialized to be\nperforming well but has non-local connections, without swapping, the network would not change\nmuch and maintain those non-local connections.\n3 Results\nWe focus first on results in the 20-Cog-tasks ; qualitatively similar results on the Mod-Cog-tasks\nare included in Appendix B.\n3.1 BIMT learns a 2D brain that solves all 20-Cog-tasks\nWe show results for A= 1.0and\u03bb= 10\u22125in Figure 1. ashows the connectivity graph of the\nRNN. All the weights are plotted as lines whose thicknesses are proportional to their magnitudes3,\nand blue/red means positive/negative weights. BIMT learns to prune away peripheral neurons and\nconcentrate important neurons only in the middle. Following [ 1], we cluster neurons into functional\nmodules based on their normalized task variance (shown in b). These functional modules, colored by\ndifferent colors, are shown to be also anatomically modular, i.e., spatially local (shown in c), visually\n2One can choose other distances, e.g., L2distance. We choose L1distance because it is more consistent with\nL1regularization.\n3Some weights are visually vanishing, because their magnitudes are too small, although we indeed plot them.\n3Figure 2: (a) The myriad ways anatomical and functional modularity can present itself in trained\nRNNs. (b) We test anatomical modularity for neural networks with BIMT (left), L1 regularization\n(middle) or no regularization (right). We propose two metrics, fraction of isolated neurons (top) and\naverage (functional) cluster size (bottom) to measure anatomical modularity. For both metrics, smaller\nis better. We compare the trained network with networks whose useful hidden neurons are randomly\nshuffled. No regularization and L1 regularization are in the distributions of randomly shuffled\nnetworks, while BIMT is significantly out of distribution (smaller) than random ones, indicating\nanatomical modularity.\nresembling a brain. By contrast, L1regularization does not induce any anatomical module. dshows\nthat the network performs reasonably well. The network is sparse; eshows that it only contains around\n100 important neurons (measured by sum of task variances). The connections in the hidden layer are\nmostly local, as we hoped; fshows that weights decay fast as distance increases, which is similar\nto fixed local-masked RNN [ 2]. However intriguingly, there is a second peak of (relatively) strong\nconnections around distances being 0.6, which is probably attributed to inter-module connections.\n3.2 Sparsity vs Accuracy Tradeoff\nThere is a Pareto frontier showing the trade-off between sparsity and accuracy, shown in Figure 1 g\nandh. We also compute the trade-off for networks with vanilla L1regularization. We use two\nsparsity measures: the number of active neurons (a neuron is active if its sum of tasks variances is\nlarger than 10\u22123), and the wiring length (sum of lengths of all active connections; a connection is\nactive if its weight magnitude is larger than 10\u22122). Under both measures, BIMT is superior than L1\nregularization in terms of having better Pareto frontier.\n3.3 Anatomical modularity\nAnatomical modularity means that neurons with similar functions are placed close to each other in\nspace. Because neurons of fully-connected layers have permutation symmetries, there is no incentive\nfor them to develop anatomical modularity. By contrast, since BIMT penalizes connection costs,\nBIMT networks potentially have anatomical modularity. In Figure 1 c, each neuron\u2019s functional cluster\nis marked and there are clear spatial clusters in which all neurons belong to the same functional cluster.\nQuantitatively, we propose two metrics: (1) the fraction of isolated neurons. A neuron is isolated if\nnone of its (eight) neighbors belongs to the same functional cluster. (2) the average size of functional\nclusters. For both metrics, the smaller the better. For baselines, we randomly shuffle important\nhidden neurons4. Since different random shuffling may yield different results, we try 10000 different\nrandom seeds and plot histograms for the metrics. We compute the two metrics for networks trained\nwith BIMT, L1regularization, or no regularization in Figure 2. Only BIMT networks are seen to be\nsignificantly out-of-distribution from baselines, implying anatomical modularity. In future work, we\nhope to explore improvements of BIMT to further increase the functional modularity of the \u201cbrain\"\nseen in Figure 1 c.\n4A neuron is important if the sum of its task variances is above 10\u22123.\n4Our main findings remain qualitatively similar when (i) the topology of hidden layer is changed or\n(ii) the tasks are significantly harder, so that they require more-involved recurrent connectivity within\nthe network. Specifically, in Appendix A, we include the results for 1D hidden layer. In Appendix B,\nwe find that results on a more-complex set of 84 cognitive tasks, the Mod-Cog-tasks [2], show\nqualitatively similar anatomical clustering results, demonstrating the robustness and generality of our\ncore findings.\nAcknowledgement\nZL and MT are supported by IAIFI through NSF grant PHY-2019786, the Foundational Questions\nInstitute and the Rothberg Family Fund for Cognitive Science.

{"text": "Dynamic trait distribution as a source for shifts in\ninteraction strength and population density\nZachary Jackson1,\u2217\nBingKan Xue1,2\n1Department of Physics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States\n2Institute for Fundamental Theory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States\nAbstract\nIntraspecific trait variation has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in\ndetermining species interaction and diversity. Eco-evolutionary models have studied the dis-\ntribution of trait values within a population that changes over the generations as a result of\nselection and heritability. Non-heritable traits that can change within the lifetime, such as\nbehavior, can cause trait-mediated indirect effects, often studied by modeling the dynamics of\na homogeneous trait. Complementary to these two approaches, we study the distribution of\ntraits within a population and its dynamics on short timescales due to ecological processes.\nWe consider several mechanisms by which the trait distribution can shift dynamically: phe-\nnotypic plasticity within each individual, differential growth among individuals, and prefer-\nential consumption by the predator. Through a simple predator-prey model that explicitly\ntracks the trait distribution within the prey, we illustrate some unusual consequences of trait\nshifts, including the healthy herd effect and the emergent promotion of the prey by the preda-\ntor. We analyze the cause of these phenomena by identifying the density and trait effects\nfrom the predator. Our results show that intraspecific trait variation and the dynamics of its\ndistribution can lead to the modification of species interactions and result in outcomes that\nare otherwise unexpected.\nIntroduction\nIn ecological modeling, it is common to use species as the basic unit of consideration, such as us-\ning the overall density of a species as a dynamical variable in Lotka-Volttera equations. However,\ntrait differences within a species cannot always be ignored. It has been increasingly recognized\nthat there is significant variation in ecologically important traits among individuals of the same\npopulation [1, 2]. Such variation can affect how individuals interact with other organisms and\ntheir environment, owing to their unique trait makeup [3,4]. It has been shown that intraspecific\ntrait variation plays an important role in community ecology [4\u20136]. The nonlinear averaging over\n1arXiv:2310.07249v1  [q-bio.PE]  11 Oct 2023intraspecific variation may affect the overall interaction between species [6, 7]; in turn, species\ninteractions can influence the trait variation within a species.\nA successful framework has been developed to describe quantitative traits and the changes\nin their distributions in the case of heritable traits [8\u201311]. In these models, the distribution of\ntrait values slowly shifts towards higher fitness through selection over many generations. This\nframework has recently been combined with shorter timescale population dynamics through an\neco-evolutionary feedback [12, 13]. Such work has mostly considered heritable traits that are\nnormally distributed [14, 15]. On the other hand, traits that are not necessarily heritable can\nvary on a timescale shorter than a generation, such as plastic traits in response to environmental\nvariability or developmental stochasticity. In particular, behavioral traits can change quickly in\nresponse to the presence of predators and can affect how the prey consume resources [16]. Such\ntrait changes and their consequences on ecological dynamics have been studied under the subject\nof trait-mediated indirect effects [3, 17, 18]. Previous work has modeled the adaptive dynamics\nof a homogeneous trait [19, 20]. Meanwhile, interesting and sometimes unintuitive results have\nbeen found in ecosystems arising from population structures within species [21]. Non-normal\ntrait distributions, such as bimodal distributions, can have strong effects on the dynamics and\nequilibrium of populations [22]. Our goal here is to incorporate such \u201ctrait structures\u201d of a\npopulation (i.e., the structure of the trait distribution within a population) into the modeling of\necological dynamics to study the consequences of short-timescale shift of trait distributions.\nConsider a species whose individuals form a distribution over a trait space, as represented\nin Figure 1A (inset). These traits could be the developmental stage, body size, morphological\npatterns, behavioral modes, or other properties that can vary from individual to individual and\ncan affect how individuals interact with others. The trait distribution can shift on ecological\ntimescales due to multiple kinds of influences. The trait value may be correlated with the growth\nrate or reproductive success of individuals. The trait distribution may thus be selected to skew\ntowards trait values associated with faster growth. Besides, predators may disproportionately\nconsume certain types of individuals because they are more enticing or easier to catch, such as\ndue to differences in chemical defense or behavior. The trait distribution of the prey will be\naffected by this preference because the consumption by the predator will shift the distribution\naway from what is consumed more of. Moreover, the trait value of an individual can change over\nits lifetime, such as by phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental signals or by switching\ninto a different behavioral mode, thus shifting the trait distribution. These types of \u201ctrait shifts\u201d\nwould induce a modification of the overall growth rate and interaction strength of the species.\nWe will study the consequences of such interaction modification due to trait shifts.\nTo develop a formalism for analyzing the effect of dynamic shift in trait distributions, we\nconsider a minimal ecosystem of one predator and one prey. We will explicitly track the trait\ndistribution within the prey population (Figure 1A). The trait value of the prey is linked to\nboth the reproduction rate of the prey and the consumption rate by the predator. By allowing\n2\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc41,\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc43\nTrait\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc411\ud835\udc412A B C\nFigure 1: (A) The interaction between a predator ( P) and prey ( N) can be influenced by the trait\nvariation within the prey population. The distribution of trait values (inset) can shift dynami-\ncally due to multiple processes. (B) A simplified model of trait distribution with two categories\nof prey ( N1and N2), consumed by the predator at different rates. There is a flow between the cat-\negories through changes in trait values within or across generations, in response to the predator,\nenvironment, or developmental stochasticity. (C) A coarse-grained picture where \u03bbrepresents\nthe trait distribution of the prey. The overall interaction strength between the species depends on\nthe trait distribution (solid arrow), and the trait distribution is in turn affected by the interaction\n(dashed arrow).\n3the trait distribution to shift dynamically, we show that there is a significant correction to the\nequilibrium of the system compared to what would otherwise be expected without the trait shift.\nIn particular, we observe the emergent promotion of the prey by the predator, whereby the prey\ndensity increases in the presence of the predator as compared to in its absence. This phenomenon\nwas found previously in a model of two predators and one prey [23]. Here it happens in an even\nsimpler system with only two species, which allows us to trace its cause by dividing the effect of\nthe predator into density and trait effects. We show that unintuitive results arise when the trait\neffect dominates over the density effect. In the situation of an infectious disease, for example, we\nsee the emergent promotion of prey population by its predator in addition to the \u201chealthy herd\neffect\u201d [24]. Such phenomena can be considered a trait-mediated direct effect, as it influences the\ntrait-shifted species itself, without involving a third species or resource at a lower trophic level.\nMethods\nWe start with Lotka-Volterra equations for a predator-prey system including the predator Pand\nthe prey N. For simplicity, we only consider trait variation within the prey. Furthermore, we\nconsider a discrete trait that can take one of two values, such that the trait distribution is given\nby a categorical distribution with two categories. This could be an approximate description of\ntrait distributions that are bimodal and the relative abundance of the two modes can change\nover time. These modes may represent behavioral modes where individual animals are either\nforaging for food or hiding from predators [25\u201327], or physical conditions where individuals\nare either healthy or infected with a disease [28, 29]. In such cases, the prey population can be\ndivided according to their trait values into two subpopulations, N1and N2(Figure 1B). We allow\nthese subpopulations to have different birth rates ( \u03bd1and\u03bd2), death rates ( \u03b41and\u03b42), and rates of\nconsumption by the predator ( \u03c71and\u03c72). In addition, there is a flow of individuals between the\nsubpopulations, which represents either individuals changing trait values during their lifetime or\nindividuals being born with a different trait from their parents. We will consider several different\nscenarios below, and will show that these scenarios can be described in a unified mathematical\nform.\nIntimidated prey\nThe first scenario is one where the presence of the predator has a significant influence on the\nbehavior of the prey. This situation has been studied as a trait-mediated indirect effect, such\nas in a system of grasshoppers and predatory spiders where the grasshoppers modified their\nfeeding-time budget and dietary choices to avoid the spiders [30, 31]. We will consider different\nbehavioral modes, such as hiding and foraging, as our trait values that distinguish between the\nsubpopulations of prey. The predator may consume the prey with certain behavior more readily,\n4and the prey may react to the predator by switching its behavior. The dynamical system of the\npredator and prey is represented by the following equations:\n\u02d9P=\u2212\u00b5P+\u03b5\u03c71PN 1+\u03b5\u03c72PN 2\n\u02d9N1=\u03bd1N1+\u03bd2N2\u2212\u03b41N1\u2212\u03b1NN 1\u2212\u03c71PN 1\u2212\u03b8(P)N1+\u03d5N2\n\u02d9N2=\u2212\u03b42N2\u2212\u03b1NN 2\u2212\u03c72PN 2+\u03b8(P)N1\u2212\u03d5N2\nThe equation for the predator ( P) includes a death rate \u00b5and a consumption term for each prey\ntype; \u03b5represents the efficiency by which consumed prey is converted into predator biomass.\nThere are two equations for the two prey types; we think of N1as the \u201csensitive\u201d type (which\nhas not yet been intimidated by the predator) and N2as the \u201cintimidated\u201d type. The prey\nequations have terms for birth, death, intraspecific competition (with the same strength \u03b1for\nboth types), and consumption by the predator. In addition, there are switching terms between\nthe subpopulations. We assume that all individuals are born sensitive and only switch to being\nintimidated when they encounter the predator. The switching rate is represented by \u03b8(P), which\ndepends on the predator density. Specifically, we assume \u03b8(P)is such that sensitive individuals\nswitch to being intimidated at a positive rate if such switching increases the overall prey growth.\nThe functional form of \u03b8(P)is shown in Table 1. We also assume that the intimidated individuals\nwill relax to being sensitive at a constant rate \u03d5.\nInherent heterogeneity\nThe second scenario we consider is one where the two prey types are born in a constant ratio\nregardless of the parental trait. We referred to this model as \u201cinherent heterogeneity\u201d in [23],\nwhich assumes that individuals cannot change traits in later stages of life. For example, certain\nmorphological traits are determined during development and do not change later, such as small\nor large horns in dimorphic beetles [32]. The dynamical system to model this scenario is given\nby the equations:\n\u02d9P=\u2212\u00b5P+\u03b5\u03c71PN 1+\u03b5\u03c72PN 2\n\u02d9N1= (1\u2212\u03c1)(\u03bd1N1+\u03bd2N2)\u2212\u03b41N1\u2212\u03b1NN 1\u2212\u03c71PN 1\n\u02d9N2=\u03c1(\u03bd1N1+\u03bd2N2)\u2212\u03b42N2\u2212\u03b1NN 2\u2212\u03c72PN 2\nHere \u03c1and(1\u2212\u03c1)are the fractions of prey that are born as type 2 and type 1, respectively. We\nconsider type 1 as the \u201csuperior\u201d type, and type 2 as the \u201cinferior\u201d type, because we choose\ntype 2 to be the trait associated with a slower growth rate, without loss of generality. The other\nterms in the prey equations, as well as the equation for the predator, are the same as for the\nintimidated prey model above. The difference is that, in the current scenario, the prey does not\nactively respond to the predator, so there are no switching terms. However, we will see that\n5these equations can be transformed mathematically to have effective switching terms that push\nthe trait distribution of the prey towards the natural composition \u03c1.\nInfectious disease\nLastly, we consider a scenario where an infectious disease spreads among the prey, which sepa-\nrates it into a \u201csusceptible\u201d subpopulation ( N1) and an \u201cinfected\u201d subpopulation ( N2). Following\nthe Susceptible-Infected (SI) model similar to [24, 33], we assume that the infected individuals\nrecover at a constant rate, but are susceptible to reinfection. We also assume that all individuals\nare born susceptible, i.e., the disease is not vertically transmitted. In addition, the consumption\nrate by the predator depends on the prey\u2019s infection status [34]. The dynamical system for this\nscenario is given by the equations:\n\u02d9P=\u2212\u00b5P+\u03b5\u03c71PN 1+\u03b5\u03c72PN 2\n\u02d9N1=\u03bd1N1+\u03bd2N2\u2212\u03b41N1\u2212\u03b1NN 1\u2212\u03c71PN 1\u2212\u03b2N1N2+\u03b3N2\n\u02d9N2=\u2212\u03b42N2\u2212\u03b1NN 2\u2212\u03c72PN 2+\u03b2N1N2\u2212\u03b3N2\nHere, infection is represented by the density-dependent term \u03b2N1N2with \u03b2being the infection\nconstant, and recovery is represented by the term \u03b3N2with \u03b3being the recovery rate. The other\nterms in the equations are the same as for the intimidated prey model above. Note that in this\ninfection model, the switching of prey types (i.e., the infection and recovery terms) depends on\nthe prey population, instead of depending on the predator as in the intimidated prey model.\nReformulation of the models\nAlthough the three models above describe very different mechanisms for intraspecific trait vari-\nation, they can be put in a common form by redefining some of the parameters. The general set\nof equations can be written as:\n\u02d9P= (\u2212\u00b5+\u03b5\u03c71N1+\u03b5\u03c72N2)P\n\u02d9N1= (\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41)N1+ (\u03bd2\u2212\u03b42)N2\u2212\u03b1NN 1\u2212\u03c71PN 1\u2212\u03c31(P,Ni)N1+\u03c32(P,Ni)N2\n\u02d9N2=\u2212\u03b1NN 2\u2212\u03c72PN 2+\u03c31(P,Ni)N1\u2212\u03c32(P,Ni)N2\nThe meanings of all the parameters are given in Table 1. The \u03c3iterms effectively represent\nswitching of the prey from one type to the other, as they appear in both equations of Niwith\nopposite signs. These terms do not affect the total population of the prey, but can change its trait\ndistribution. The specific forms of these terms for each model are listed in Table 1. Note that\neven in the model of inherent heterogeneity, where individuals do not change their phenotype,\nthere are still effective switching terms coming from individuals dying and being replaced with\nthe other type.\n6Table 1: Parameters in the models\nParameter Meaning\n\u00b5 predator death rate\n\u03b5 predator conversion efficiency\n\u03c7i predator consumption rate\n\u03bdi prey reproduction rate\n\u03b4i prey death rate\n\u03b1 prey intraspecific competition\nIntimidated prey \u03c31=Max[0,\u03b7(P(\u03c71\u2212\u03c72)\u2212(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41) + (\u03bd2\u2212\u03b42))],\u03c32=\u03b42+\u03d5\n\u03b7 prey reaction strength\n\u03d5 prey relaxation rate\nInherent heterogeneity \u03c31=\u03c1\u03bd1,\u03c32=\u03b42\u2212\u03c1\u03bd2\n\u03c1 prey birth ratio\nInfectious disease \u03c31=\u03b2N2,\u03c32=\u03b42+\u03b3\n\u03b2 prey infection constant\n\u03b3 prey recovery rate\nTo focus on the trait distribution of the prey, we further transform these equations in terms\nof the total prey population N=N1+N2and the fraction \u03bb=N2/N(Figure 1C).

Therefore, the effect of trait shift is\ncaptured by the dynamics of \u03bbin Eq. (3) and how it changes the effective interaction strength\n7Table 2: Transformed switching terms for different models\nModel S1 S2\nIntimidated prey Max [0,u(P(c1\u2212c2)\u2212r)]d+f\nInherent heterogeneity \u03c1b (1\u2212\u03c1)d\u2212\u03c1(1\u2212r)\nInfectious disease q(1\u2212\u03bb)N d +g\nwhere b=\u03bd1/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41),d=\u03b42/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41),u=\u03b7/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41),q=\u03b2/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41),f=\u03d5/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41),\ng=\u03b3/(\u03bd1\u2212\u03b41).\nceffand growth rate beff. Among the four terms in Eq. (3), the first term is the shift in the\nprey distribution due to consumption by the predator. The trait distribution shifts away from\nthe preference of the predator because the predator consumes more of what it prefers. The\nsecond term comes from the difference in growth rate associated with different trait values. The\ndistribution shifts towards the trait value that allows individuals to grow faster. The third and\nfourth terms are the switching terms that depend on the specific model. Thus, the shape of\nthe trait distribution can be modified by a combination of preferential consumption, differential\ngrowth, and effective switching.\nComparison of density and trait effects\nTo find the effect of trait shift, we will compare the behavior of the full system to a model with\na fixed trait distribution. We can separate the \u201ctrait effect\u201d from the \u201cdensity effect\u201d that both\narise from introducing the predator to a system with only the prey. When the system consists\nof only the prey, the equilibrium prey population is N0and the natural trait distribution is \u03bb0.\nWhen the predator is introduced, the new equilibrium prey population is N\u2217and the new trait\ndistribution is \u03bb\u2217. We will denote by N\u2217(\u03bb\u2217)the equilibrium prey population in the presence\nof the predator (when the trait distribution is \u03bb\u2217), and N0(\u03bb0)the equilibrium prey population\nwithout the predator (when the trait distribution is \u03bb0). Introducing the predator into the system\ncauses a trait shift in the prey, \u2206\u03bb=\u03bb\u2217\u2212\u03bb0, as well as a change in the density of the prey,\n\u2206N=N\u2217\u2212N0. We will divide this prey density change into a density effect and a trait effect\nfrom the predator, \u2206N=\u2206ND+\u2206NT, as follows.\nIn order to isolate the density effect, we introduce N\u2217(\u03bb0)and P\u2217(\u03bb0), which are the hypo-\nthetical populations at equilibrium when the trait distribution of the prey is held at its natural\nvalue \u03bb0. Mathematically, these are given by solving Eqs. (1\u20132) with a fixed \u03bb:\nN\u2217(\u03bb) =m\nceff(\u03bb),P\u2217(\u03bb) =beff(\u03bb)\u2212m/ceff(\u03bb)\nceff(\u03bb)(4)\nIn the absence of the trait shift, the density effect can be defined as the change in prey population\ndue to the introduction of the predator, i.e., \u2206ND=N\u2217(\u03bb0)\u2212N0(\u03bb0). Then the trait effect is\n8the change in prey population due to the trait shift, i.e., \u2206NT=N\u2217(\u03bb\u2217)\u2212N\u2217(\u03bb0). Similarly, the\ntrait shift of the prey has a \u201cback-reaction\u201d on the predator, i.e., \u2206PT=P\u2217(\u03bb\u2217)\u2212P\u2217(\u03bb0). This\nback-reaction measures how the trait shift caused by the predator affects the population of the\npredator itself. It is important to note that, because \u2206PTis a back-reaction from the prey, changes\nin both prey population and trait distribution are involved. We will examine these different\neffects to understand the behavior of the predator-prey system.\nResults\nOur reformulation of the three different models allows us to analyze their behavior using the\nsame method. Example trajectories of the dynamical systems (Eqs. 1\u20133) are shown in Figure 2.\nEach time series starts with the system at equilibrium with only the prey present. The predator\nis introduced and the system is allowed to equilibrate (solid curves). We also consider the hypo-\nthetical situation where the prey trait distribution is held at its natural value (dashed curves).\nFigure 2AB shows a pair of time series for the intimidated prey model. The prey reacts to the\npredator by switching behavioral modes depending on the predator\u2019s feeding preference. In the\nfirst time series (Figure 2A), the predator prefers to consume the intimidated type. As a result,\nthe composition of the prey shifts away from its preference, which can be seen from the solid\npurple curve that shows a decreased \u03bb. This trait shift in the prey has a negative back-reaction on\nthe predator population, as shown by the fact that the equilibrium value reached by the solid red\ncurve is lower than that reached by the dashed red curve. In the second time series (Figure 2B)\nwhere the predator prefers the sensitive type, however, the trait shift helps more prey survive\nand in turn increases the predator population. This can be seen by noticing that the equilibrium\nreached by the solid lines are higher than that reached by the dashed lines of each color. Thus,\neven though in both cases the trait shift goes against the predator\u2019s preference, the back-reaction\non the predator can be either negative or positive.\nFigure 2CD shows a similar story for the inherent heterogeneity model, where the prey are\nborn into either type and do not react to the predator. In this model the trait shift is caused solely\nby the predator\u2019s preferential consumption of the prey types. Two examples are shown, where\nthe growth rate difference between the two prey types is more pronounced in the first example.\nIn both cases the shift in prey composition is away from the predator\u2019s preference. We see once\nagain that the predator population can be decreased (Figure 2C) or increased (Figure 2D) by\nthe shift in prey composition: The solid red line representing the predator population reaches\nan equilibrium that is below the dashed red line in Figure 2C but above the dashed red line in\nFigure 2D.\nFigure 2EF shows example time series for the infectious disease model. Here, the trait distri-\nbution \u03bbis the proportion of the population infected with the disease. In both of the examples\nshown in the figure, introducing the predator relieves the prey of the disease, as \u03bbgoes down.\n901.6Intimidated PreyP,NA\n01\u03bb\n01.6P,NB\n0 4001\nt\u03bbInherent Heterogeneity\nC\nD\n0 40 tInfectious Disease\nE\nF\n0 150 tP P(\u03bb=\u03bb0)N N(\u03bb=\u03bb0)\u03bb \u03bb0Figure 2: Example trajectories of the three models showing different behaviors depending on the\nprey growth rate difference and predator consumption preference. Panels (A,C,E) correspond\nto triangles in Figures 3-5, and panels (B,D,F) correspond to circles in Figures 3-5. Parameter\nvalues used for the intimidated prey model are: (c,d,m,u,f) = ( 1.5, 0.1, 0.4, 5, 0.2 );(x,r) =\n(0.25,\u22120.5)in panel (A), and (x,r) = ( 0.8,\u22120.6)in (B). For the inherent heterogeneity model:\n(c,d,m,\u03c1,b) = ( 1.3, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 1.0 );(x,r) = ( 0.9, 0.5 )in (C), and (x,r) = ( 0.97, 0.05 )in (D). For\nthe infectious disease model: (c,d,m,q,g) = ( 1.2, 0.1, 0.25, 1.8, 0.1 );(x,r) = ( 0.2, 0.95 )in (E), and\n(x,r) = ( 0.55, 0.95 )in (F).\n10This is true even for the case where the predator slightly prefers susceptible prey (Figure 2F),\nbecause the prey population is reduced such that the spread of the disease is suppressed. On the\nother hand, the effect on the prey population is very different between the two examples. In Fig-\nure 2F, introducing the predator causes the prey population to fall drastically, but the shift in the\nprey composition has almost no effect on the equilibrium prey population (solid and dashed blue\ncurves). However, in Figure 2E, when the predator is introduced, the prey population decreases\nif the trait composition is held fixed (dashed blue curve), but increases if the composition is al-\nlowed to shift (solid blue curve). This is an example of emergent promotion, which we explore\nin more detail below.\nThese examples already illustrate some nontrivial outcomes of dynamic trait shifts, including\nthe emergent promotion of the prey and the back reaction on the predator. To explore the\ngenerality of those examples, we will carry out a systematic study of the parameter space below.\nThe different dynamics among the similar systems can be attributed to different combinations of\ndensity and trait effects.\nPhase diagrams\nWe examine the systems over the parameter space of the growth difference between the prey\ntypes and the feeding preference of the predator. The difference in growth rate between the two\nprey types is captured by the parameter r. When r=0, the growth rates of both prey types are\nequal; when r<0, the growth rate of type 2 prey is larger than type 1, and vice versa. In the\nintimidated prey model, we explore rin the range from \u22121 to 1; in the inherent heterogeneity\nmodel, we explore rfrom 0 to 1, because we have assumed type 1 to grow faster without loss of\ngenerality; and in the infectious disease model, we also explore rfrom 0 to 1, because a disease\ntends to reduce the growth rate of the prey. To capture the preference of the predator, we set\nc1=x cand c2= (1\u2212x)c, so that 0 \u2264x\u22641 controls how strongly the predator prefers one type\nof prey over the other. When x\u21920, the predator strongly prefers type 2 prey; when x\u21921, the\npredator strongly prefers type 1 prey; and when x=0.5, the predator has no preference.\nWe present our results as a phase diagram that shows whether a population (or subpopu-\nlation) persists at the equilibrium (panel A in Figures 3\u20135). \u201cP\u201d represents the predator, \u201cS\u201d\nrepresents type-1 prey (sensitive, superior, or susceptible), and \u201cI\u201d represents type-2 prey (in-\ntimidated, inferior, or infected). In the model of intimidated prey, three kinds of equilibria are\npossible: S, PS, and PSI (Figure 3A). The S-phase is where only sensitive (unintimidated) prey\nare present, because the predator cannot persist. The PS-phase is where the predator persists\nbut is not enough to intimidate the prey, so there is only the predator and sensitive prey. The\nPSI-phase is where the predator and both types of prey coexist. In the model of inherent hetero-\ngeneity, both types of prey are persistent because they are born in a given ratio. Consequently,\nthere are two possible phases: SI and PSI (Figure 4A). The SI-phase is where the predator cannot\n11persist because it strongly prefers the slowly growing prey type, and the PSI-phase is where the\npredator coexists with the prey. In the model of infectious disease, there are three phases: SI,\nPS, and PSI (Figure 5A). The SI-phase is where the predator cannot persist, similar to the other\nmodels, and the prey consists of both types because of the spreading disease. The PS-phase is\nwhere the predator persists but the infection does not spread, so all prey are healthy. Finally, the\nPSI-phase is where the predator, susceptible prey, and infected prey coexist.\nWe also plot heatmaps to show how the trait shift ( \u2206\u03bb), density effect ( \u2206ND) and trait effect\n(\u2206NT) depend on the parameters (panels B,D,E in Figures 3\u20135). There are parameter regimes for\nall three models where the effects of introducing the predator are as expected. These correspond\nto regions where the predator has a strong preference in prey type. In these regions the introduc-\ntion of the predator shifts the trait value \u03bbaway from its preference. This causes the trait effect\n\u2206NTto be positive, because the shift of the prey distribution reduces the overall consumption\nrate of the predator. On the other hand, the density effect \u2206NDis always negative, because the\nintroduction of a predator without allowing a shift in the prey composition can only result in a\npositive consumption rate that reduces the prey population. In most cases the trait effect on the\nprey is not large enough to overcome the density effect from the predator, so the overall change\nin the prey population \u2206N(panel C in Figures 3\u20135) is negative. However, in some cases the trait\neffect is strong enough to change the result qualitatively, as we show below.\nEmergent promotion of prey by predator\nIn the region between the dashed lines in Figure 5C, we have \u2206N>0, which means the prey\npopulation is larger when the predator is present rather than absent. This is an example of\nemergent promotion described in [23], whereby the introduction of a predator counterintuitively\nincreases the prey population. Note that in the same region we have \u2206ND<0 (Figure 5D),\nwhich means the prey population would have decreased if the trait distribution was held fixed.\nTherefore, emergent promotion only arises because of the trait shift in the prey. Here the trait shift is\naway from the predator\u2019s preference ( \u2206\u03bb<0, Figure 5B), so the trait effect is positive ( \u2206NT>0,\nFigure 5E). In this particular region, the positive trait effect is strong enough to overcome the\nnegative density effect, resulting in a net increase in the prey population.\nThe relationship between \u2206NDand\u2206NTcan be visualized with a scatter plot shown in Fig-\nure 6. Each point corresponds to a particular pair of ( x,r) values, and is colored by the value of\n\u2206\u03bb(from panel B in Figures 3\u20135). In Figure 6ABC, the diagonal dashed line is where \u2206N=\u2206ND\n(i.e.,\u2206NT=0), and the horizontal dashed line is where \u2206N=0. In the lower triangle between\nthe two dashed lines, the trait shift has a positive effect on the prey population ( \u2206NT>0), but\nnot enough to overcome the negative density effect ( \u2206ND<0), and so the overall effect of the\npredator is to reduce the prey population ( \u2206N<0). Above the horizontal dashed line, the effect\nof the trait shift is large enough to overcome the density effect (so that \u2206N>0), leading to the\n12Figure 3: The intimidated prey model.

Parameter values are the same as for Figure 2EF.\n15promotion of the prey by the predator. Note that for all three models that we consider, \u2206NDis\nalways negative. That is, in the absence of a trait shift, introducing a predator always decreases\nthe population of the prey. For both the intimidated prey and inherent heterogeneity models\n(Figure 6AB), all points are inside the lower triangle between the dashed lines, meaning that the\ntrait effect is always positive but not enough to cause promotion. However, for the infectious\ndisease model (Figure 6C), there are points above the horizontal dashed line, showing that the\neffect of the trait shift can be strong enough to promote the prey population overall.\nBack-reaction on predator\nIn most regions of the phase diagrams, particularly where the predator has a strong preference,\nthe trait shift is towards a prey composition that is unfavorable for the predator. This can be\nunderstood as a result of picking up all the \u201clower-hanging fruits\u201d, only to be left with hard-to-\nget targets. In analogy, some prey are consumed more readily due to their particular trait values,\nand the remaining ones will be composed of more unfavorable prey. This forms a negative\nback-reaction on the predator ( \u2206PT<0), as the predator is responsible for shifting the prey\ncomposition unfavorably for itself. Some regions of the parameter space that show this effect are\nthe regions containing the triangular points in Figures 3\u20135.\nHowever, there are situations where the back-reaction is positive for the predator ( \u2206PT>0).\nOne region of particular interest is outlined in Figure 4F, enclosing the circular point. Here\nthe trait shift is strongly away from the predator\u2019s preference, but \u2206PTis still positive. This is\nbecause there are two competing factors at play. The first is that the trait shift in the prey causes\nthe predator to consume at a lower average rate. The second is that the trait shift also increases\nthe equilibrium prey population ( \u2206NT>0), which helps increase the predator population. If\nthe latter factor is more dominant, then it leads to the surprising result that the trait shift goes\nagainst the predator\u2019s preference but is favorable for the predator after all.\nIt is also interesting that in the above case the trait shift benefits both the predator and prey\nat the same time. Figure 6DEF visualizes the relationship between \u2206PTand\u2206NT. The upper\nright quadrant is where both \u2206PT>0 and \u2206NT>0. In the models of intimidated prey and\ninherent heterogeneity (Figure 6DE), even though the back-reaction on the predator can be either\npositive or negative, the trait effect on the prey is always positive ( \u2206NT>0). In the infectious\ndisease model (Figure 6F), there are cases where the trait effect on the prey is negative ( \u2206NT<0),\nbecause in this scenario the trait shift not only results from the predator through consumption or\nintimidation, but also follows its own dynamic rules (the infection can be considered a parasite\nspecies that has its own population dynamics).\n16Figure 6: (A\u2013C) Relationship between the total effect of the predator on the prey ( \u2206N) and\nthe density effect ( \u2206ND). The diagonal dashed line is where the trait effect \u2206NT=0, and the\nhorizontal dashed line is where \u2206N=0. The density effect is always negative; above the diagonal\nis where the trait effect is positive, and above the horizontal line is where the trait effect is strong\nenough to overcome the negative density effect to result in emergent promotion of the prey by\nthe predator. (D\u2013F) Relationship between the trait effect on the prey ( \u2206NT) and the back-reaction\non the predator ( \u2206PT). The back-reaction can be either negative or positive. The scattered points\ncorrespond to grid points in the parameter space from Figures 3\u20135, colored according to \u2206\u03bb; solid\nlines correspond to the boundaries of the parameter space from Figures 3\u20135. \u2206N,\u2206ND, and\u2206NT\nare normalized by the prey population before introducing the predator, and \u2206PTis normalized\nby the predator population without trait shift.\n17Discussion\nOur analysis of the above models in a unified framework represents a general way of treating\ninteraction between the predator and prey when there is intraspecific trait variation. We have\nfound qualitatively different, and sometimes surprising, behaviors of these systems when the\ndynamic shift of the trait distribution is taken into account. Those results can be understood by\ncomparing the relative strengths of density and trait effects from the predator to the prey, as well\nas the back-reaction to the predator.\nDirect vs indirect trait-mediated effects\nThe interaction strength between a pair of species can be affected by the presence of other species\nin their environment. When a third species affects the trait of one of the interacting species and\nthus modifies the interaction strength between those two species, it is known as a \u201ctrait-mediated\nindirect effect\u201d [3]. Past studies of trait effects have mostly focused on such indirect effects, such\nas in trophic cascades [35\u201338]. In these situations, the predator may affect the behavior of the\nprey, thereby alter the prey\u2019s consumption of lower level resources. The trait effect that we focus\non in our model can be called a \u201cdirect\u201d effect, because it is a modification of the interaction\nstrength by one of the two interacting species. This may be the simplest form of trait-mediated\neffects involving the fewest number of species.\nHealthy herd effect\nWhen the introduction of a predator reduces the prevalence of a disease in a prey population,\nit is known as the \u201chealthy herd effect\u201d [24, 39\u201341]. This effect can be seen in the \u2206\u03bbplot for\nthe infectious disease model (Fig. 5B). Since here \u03bbrepresents the proportion of infected prey,\nthe healthy herd effect is present wherever \u2206\u03bb<0. However, there can be different mechanisms\nbehind this effect [42]. It can arise from either a reduction in prey population density that reduces\nthe spread of the disease [40, 41], or a strong preference for infected prey by the predator that\nreduces the subpopulation of infected prey [42]. Our results show clear regions in the parameter\nspace that represent each of these mechanisms. In the region of x>0.5, the predator prefers\nhealthy prey, so the effect must be from the reduction in prey density that leads to a slower\ninfection rate. On the other hand, in the region enclosed in the dashed curve (Fig. 5C), the\nprey density actually increases upon introducing the predator, and this is also a region where\nthe predator strongly prefers to consume infected prey, so the effect must be from preferential\nconsumption. In between these two regions, there is a continuum where the healthy herd effect\nis caused by a combination of the two mechanisms. Moreover, we can distinguish these two\nmechanisms by whether the density effect or the trait effect dominates. Where the density effect\nis strong compared to the trait effect (Fig. 5D), it is the reduction in density that causes a healthier\n18prey population; where the trait effect is dominant (Fig.5E), it is the preferential consumption by\nthe predator that causes the healthy herd effect.\nAlternative definitions of trait effect\nOur way of splitting the overall effect of a predator on the prey into density and trait effects is\nideal for situations where the trait distribution \u03bbcan be measured and controlled. To estimate\n\u2206NT, for example, requires measuring the predator and prey populations while holding \u03bbcon-\nstant. This is not always practical. There are alternative definitions of density and trait effects (as\nreviewed in [3, 43]), which focus on the indirect effect of the predator on lower level resources.\nSpecifically, one defines a \u201ctrue predator\u201d that has all its natural interactions with the prey, and\na \u201cthreat predator\u201d that lacks the ability to consume the prey but can still influence the prey be-\nhavior by their presence. These definitions are useful for experiments such as [16, 44], where the\npredator can be disarmed or caged to remove their consumption ability. In those experiments,\nthe trait effect is defined as N\u2020\u2212N0, and the density effect is N\u2217\u2212N\u2020, where N\u2020is the equilib-\nrium density of the prey in the presence of the threat predator, and N\u2217and N0are the same as\nin our definition (the equilibrium prey density with and without the true predator).\nCompared to our definitions of density and trait effects, the difference is in the choice of the\nmidpoint and the order of subtraction. Whereas we use N\u2217(\u03bb0)as the midpoint to parse out\nthe density effect first, the alternative definitions above use N\u2020to parse out the trait effect first.\nThe latter removes the need to control the trait composition of the prey directly. However, it also\nintroduces ambiguity into interpreting the density effect defined this way. This is because the\nthreat predator and true predator will not necessarily shift the trait of the prey in the same way.\nFor example, the true predator may further shift the prey traits by preferential consumption, as\nin our model. Thus, the density effect so defined will include some unknown amount of trait\neffect. In contrast, with the definitions that we propose, no such ambiguity exists, at the expense\nof having to control the trait distribution directly.\nSuch control has been implemented in [16, 44] by \u201cculling\u201d the prey, i.e., a treatment where\nno predator is present but some prey are removed manually to simulate the action of predator\nwithout affecting the behavior of the prey. This is similar to our definition of N\u2217(\u03bb0)in that it\nattempts to isolate the density effect of the predator without inducing a trait shift. This protocol\nis useful when investigating the indirect effect on lower level resources. However, if the goal is to\nmeasure the direct effect on the prey itself, the prey population should be measured rather than\nmanipulated; only the composition of the prey should be held constant. This could potentially be\naccomplished by replacing individuals in the population with those of particular trait values from\na separate pool to maintain a constant trait composition in the population. Such a replacement\nprotocol has been used in eco-evolutionary studies to constrain the evolution of populations in\nmulti-generational studies [45, 46].\n19We have also defined a back-reaction of the trait effect on the predator population. Previous\nexperiments on trait effects are often short-term, during which the predator population remains\nconstant. Consequently, no back-reaction on the predator can be measured. To test the trait-\nmediated back-reaction in our model would require longer-term experiments where the predator\npopulation is allowed to equilibrate, alongside the prey population. Our theoretical results shown\nhere provide an expectation for such longer-term empirical studies in future.\nConclusion\nWe have presented simple predator-prey models to demonstrate the effect that a dynamic trait\ndistribution within a population can have on the interaction between species. Such effects can\nhave profound implications for larger, more diverse ecosystems. For instance, in the context of\ntrophic cascade, it is often thought that a predator would have a negative impact on its immediate\nprey, but a positive effect on species at the next trophic level [47]. However, emergent promotion\nthat is made possible by dynamic trait shift, as illustrated in our model, can potentially reverse\nthe expected trend. By analyzing the density and trait effects, we expect to be able to understand\nsuch unintuitive outcomes of community dynamics and avoid unwarranted assumptions about\nspecies interactions.\nOur work shows the importance of considering the dynamical shift of trait distributions on\nshort timescales due to ecological processes, complementary to the slow shift due to evolution\nthat has been studied in eco-evolutionary models [12\u201315]. The models studied here are simplified\nexamples that include only two trait values within a single species. This approach can be gen-\neralized by considering more compartments or a continuous distribution of trait values within a\npopulation. We have considered the shift of a single trait, but in reality even a single species has\nmany traits that can shift and alter its interactions in a large ecosystem. How to analyze realistic\nsystems with many species, each with a high-dimensional space of shifting traits, is left to future\nstudy.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Robert Holt and Mathew Leibold for helpful discussions.\nLiterature Cited\n[1] A C Westerband, J L Funk, and K E Barton.

This is especially true\ngiven the slight but non-negligible increase of deaths in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic [56]. Human\nmalaria is caused by one of 5 plasmodial species: Plasmodium falciparum ,P. vivax ,P. malariae ,P. ovale\nandP. knowlesi (with P. falciparum being the most pathogenic species infecting humans [31]) that are\ntransmitted by the bites of female Anopheles mosquitoes, most commonly from An. gambiae sensu stricto ,\nAn. coluzzii ,An. arabiensis and species of the An. funestus complex in Africa [42]. Introduced more than\none century ago by Ross [41], the first mathematical model for malaria transmission was refined later by\nMacDonald [34]. Models for vector-transmitted diseases are still a wide subject of study in epidemiology,\nseee.g.[9, 26, 33] and some references therein. In 2019, about 55% of the worldwide deaths were among\nthe youngest population, i.e.less than 5 years old [57]. Furthermore, the human infectious reservoir is\nbelieved to be mostly children between 5 and 15-year-old [15, 21]. Therefore, an explicit age structure of\nthe host population seems a natural requirement for the mathematical modelling of malaria epidemiology\n[52, 53] or even within-host dynamics [1, 50]. In addition, the production of gametocytes within a human\nhost is strongly related to the time post-infection [19], hence a number of recent studies tracking the\ntime post-infection in their models e.g.[10, 17, 54, 55]. Finally, the importance of mosquito senescence\nand the need to include it in models was put forward in [7, 47] but only considered recently [40]. In a\nprevious work [39], we studied an age-structured model of the transmission of malaria parasites between\nmosquitoes and humans, where multiple structuring variables are taken into account: chronological and\ninfection ages of both populations, as well as the time since recovery to describe potential humans waning\nimmunity. In [39], well-posedness was first handled, then formulas for the basic reproduction number and\nvectorial capacity were derived, as well as conditions for backward and forward bifurcations.\nIn the present paper, we expand the analysis of the age-structured model developed in [39] and focus on\nthe derivation of entomological and epidemiological results commonly used in the literature, following the\nworks of Smith and McKenzie [43, 44, 45] and in particular [44] where the authors derived the equations of\na number of statistics based on the ODE framework. Here we generalize these results to the age-structured\ncase. In order to quantify the impact of neglecting structuring variables such as chronological age, we\nassigned values from the literature to our model parameters. While some parameters values are readily\naccessible from the literature, at least those about the human population, the parameters concerning\n1arXiv:2310.07275v1  [q-bio.PE]  11 Oct 2023mosquitoes are less commonly documented and the values of a number of them (e.g. mosquito survival\nin the presence or in absence of infection) can be discussed extensively.\n2 Description of the model\n2.1 Model overview\nWe remind here of the model introduced in [39] and the different notations that will be used all along\nthe paper. Let call Sh(t, a) the density of humans of age a\u22650, that are susceptible to the infection\nat time t\u22650. These individuals can become infected due to bites of infected mosquitoes with the rate\n\u03bbm(t, a), called the force of infection of mosquitoes to susceptible humans of age a. The infected human\npopulation is additionally structured by the time since infection, called infection age, with Ih(t, a, \u03c4 ) the\ndensity at time tof individuals of age athat have been infected for a duration \u03c4\u22650. A human host\nof age aand infected for a duration \u03c4can either recover at the rate \u03b3h(a, \u03c4), or die from the infection\nat the rate \u03bdh(a, \u03c4). Upon recovery, Rh(t, a, \u03b7 ) is the density at time tof human hosts of age athat\nrecovered at time t\u2212\u03b7\u22650. Recovered human hosts lose their immunity at the rate kh(\u03b7) and return to\nthe susceptible compartment Sh. Death due to natural causes can occur at each step of the infection at\nthe age-dependent rate \u00b5h(a). Finally, the human reproduction is assumed to occur at the constant rate\n\u039bhdepicting a constant flux of newborns.\nSimilarly, we call Sm(t, a) the density of susceptible mosquitoes of age aat time t. These mosquitoes\nbecome infected upon a blood meal from infected humans at rate \u03bbh(t, a), called the force of infection of\nhumans to mosquitoes with age a. Susceptible mosquitoes die with the age-dependent natural death rate\n\u00b5m(a), while infected mosquitoes that have been infected for a duration \u03c4die at rate \u03bdm(a, \u03c4). Note here\nthat, in order to ensure the positivity of all the parameters, the rate \u03bdmis not an additional death rate\ndue to infection as we assumed in [39]. Indeed, recent experiments show that among old mosquitoes, the\nsurvival of infected individuals is higher than that of uninfected counterparts (see [46]) thus leading to\n\u03bdm(a, \u03c4)< \u00b5m(a), at least for old age aand some infection age \u03c4. Finally, as for the human population,\nthe flux of newborn mosquitoes is assumed constant at the rate \u039b m. The human-mosquitoes infection life\ncycle is shown in Figure 1 and the infection process is described in the next section.\n2.2 The infection process\nThe total number of human and mosquitoes at time tis described as follows\nNh(t) =Z\u221e\n0Sh(t, a)da+Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0Ih(t, a, \u03c4 )dad\u03c4+Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0Rh(t, a, \u03b7 )dad\u03b7,\nNm(t) =Z\u221e\n0Sm(t, a)da+Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0Im(t, a, \u03c4 )dad\u03c4.\nThe force of infection from mosquitoes to human with age ais then given by:\n\u03bbm(t, a) =1\nNh(t)Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0\u03b8\u03b2m(s, \u03c4)Im(t, s, \u03c4 )dsd\u03c4 (1)\nso that Sh(t, a)\u03bbm(t, a) describes the number of newly infected humans with age aat time t.

This allows quantifying the expected number of secondary human\n(respectively mosquito) infections resulting from a single primary human (resp. mosquito) infection into\nan otherwise susceptible population.

Note that Rm\u2192h\n0 is also called the\nvectorial capacity [22]. More precisely, we have [39]:\nRh\u2192m\n0 =Z\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)ds\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212R\u03be\n0\u00b5h(s)dsd\u03be| {z }\nProp. human of age aZ\u221e\n0\u03b2h(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u00d7Prob. to remain infectedz }| {\ne\u2212R\u03c4\n0(\u00b5h(\u03be+a)+\u03bdh(\u03be+a,\u03be)+\u03b3h(\u03be+a,\u03be))d\u03be\n| {z }\nTransmission prob. of infected humand\u03c4da\n4and\nRm\u2192h\n0 =Z\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)ds\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)dsda| {z }\nProp. mosquito of age a\u00d7Rm\u2192h\n0(a)da (7)\nwhere Rm\u2192h\n0(a) denotes the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes population infected at age aand is explicitly\ngiven by\nRm\u2192h\n0(a) =\u039bmR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)dsda\n\u039bhR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)dsda| {z }\nMosquito/human ratio\u00d7\u03b82\u00d7Z\u221e\n0\u03b2m(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u00d7Surv. prob. of infected mosquitoz}| {\ne\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(\u03be+a,\u03be)d\u03be\n| {z }\nTransmission prob. of infected mosquitod\u03c4.\nIn the following, we will focus on the description of each factor intervening in the decomposition of the\ntransmission capabilities and how it can be determined in practice by using existing data.\n3.1 Human transmission capability\n3.1.1 Demographic structure of the human population\nThe demography of the human population plays an important role in the transmission dynamics of\nmalaria. As said in the introduction, the human infectious reservoir is known to be age-dependant. Here\nwe consider the population of Bobo Dioulasso, the second biggest city in Burkina Faso where the spread\nof malaria is important.\nThe initial population Sh,0corresponds to the population in Bobo Dioulasso in 2012 [29, Table A.4.6]\nwith the age-structure of the city [27, Table 4.6] (see Figure 2 (a)). The human recruitment rate is chosen\nas \u039b h= 30754/year corresponding to a birth rate estimated to 3 .78% [27, p.16] within Bobo, with a total\npopulation of 813 610 in 2012. The natural human death rate \u00b5his estimated in [28, Table A.1] (see\nFigure 2 (b)).\nConsidering that malaria mortality \u03bdhis negligible compared to the natural mortality, we can esti-\nmate the demographic age-structure reached by the population after some time, under the assumption\nthat the mortality does not vary with time. This is given by the function a7\u2212\u2192\u039bhe\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)dswhich\nmathematically corresponds to the disease-free equilibrium, where the function \u03c0s\nh(a) =e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)dsis\nthe probability for humans to survive from birth to age a, in absence of malaria infections. We can then\ndefine the proportion of human of age areached by the population as:\nPh(a) =e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)ds\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212R\u03be\n0\u00b5h(s)dsd\u03be=\u03c0s\nh(a)R\u221e\n0\u03c0s\nh(\u03be)d\u03be\nwhich appears in the computation of the transmission capability and is represented in Figure 2 (c). We\ncan observe a few changes in the demography leading to a larger and older population, with a bigger\nlife expectancy (numerically around 64 years old for about 2 million inhabitants). This can easily be\nexplained by the decreasing of both the mortality and the birth rates over the years.\nIn practice, the mortality due to malaria infections can indeed be neglected since malaria cause around\n4000 deaths each year in Burkina Faso [18, Table 4.74] while the crude mortality rate was estimated to\n1.18% in 2006 [29] corresponding to more than 100 000 deaths each year in Burkina Faso with a total\npopulation of 14 millions inhabitants in 2006 [27].\n3.1.2 Probability to remain infected\nThe time lapse between the infection and the recovery or the death of individuals is a key parameter\nin the transmission process. Indeed, only infectious individuals can contribute to the spread of malaria\n5(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 2: (a) The population age-structure of Bobo Dioulasso in 2012.

Considering humans getting infected at age a, they will remain infected for \u03c4days with the\nprobability given by\n\u03c0i\nh(a, \u03c4) =e\u2212R\u03c4\n0(\u00b5h(\u03be+a)+\u03bdh(\u03be+a,\u03be)+\u03b3h(\u03be+a,\u03be))d\u03be\nrevealing the human death rate induced by the infection \u03bdhand the recovery rate \u03b3h. The mortality rate\n\u03bdhis based on the malaria lethality at age a, denoted by \u03bdh(a). The latter is given in [18] by computing\nthe number of deaths over the total number of mild [18, Table 4.73] and severe [18, Table 4.74] malaria\ncases in the Hauts Bassins region (see Table 2).\nAge (years old) [0,1] [1,5] [5,15] [15,+\u221e)\nMalaria lethality rate 1.07\u00d710\u221237.02\u00d710\u221244.55\u00d710\u221245.73\u00d710\u22125\nTable 2: Age-dependent malaria lethality rate for humans\nThe human incubation period is estimated to be approximately 10 days [12, 36] while death generally\noccurs within 1 to 5 days after the incubation period, with a mean duration of symptoms until death\nof 2.8 days [23]. In order to have 95% of the deaths occurring between 10 and 15 days post-infection,\nwe make the assumption that the distribution of the occurrence of the deaths due to malaria, denoted\nby \u03a6 \u03bd(\u03c4), follows the Gaussian law N(12.5,1.276) and is normalized to have a total mass equal to one:R\u221e\n0\u03a6\u03bd(\u03c4)d\u03c4= 1, i.e.\n\u03a6\u03bd(\u03c4) =exp\u0010\n\u2212(\u03c4\u221212.5)2\n2\u00d71.2762\u0011\nR\u221e\n0exp\u0010\n\u2212(s\u221212.5)2\n2\u00d71.2762\u0011\nds.\nFinally, the mortality rate \u03bdh(a, \u03c4) of human of age a, with \u03c4days post-infection is chosen as\n\u03bdh(a, \u03c4) =\u03bdh(a)\u03a6\u03bd(\u03c4)\n1\u2212\u03bdh(a)F\u03a6\u03bd(\u03c4)\n(see Figure 3 (a)) where F\u03a6\u03bddenotes the cumulative distribution function of \u03a6 \u03bd. Under this assumption,\nthe distribution of the deaths due to malaria according to the time since infection numerically satisfies\nthe Gaussian law \u03a6 \u03bdwhen following a cohort of newly infected humans.\nThe time required to clear the parasite was estimated in [6, 36] and is age-dependant (see Table 3).\nIn order to compute the recovery rate \u03b3h, we first make the assumption that the clearance for a human\nof age afollows the Gaussian distribution \u03a6 \u03b3(a, \u03c4), according to the time since infection \u03c4, centered in\nthe middle of each range, while we choose the variance so that 95% occurs within this range. We then\nconsider the following recovery rate (see Figure 3 (b)):\n\u03b3h(a, \u03c4) =\u03a6\u03b3(a\u2212\u03c4, \u03c4)\n1\u2212F\u03a6\u03b3(a\u2212\u03c4, \u03c4),\n6where F\u03a6\u03b3denotes the cumulative distribution function of \u03a6 \u03b3. Note that a\u2212\u03c4corresponds to the age at\nwhich infected humans were contaminated. Finally, the probability \u03c0i\nh(a, \u03c4) for an infected human of age\nato remain infected for \u03c4days is illustrated in Figure 4.\nAge (years) [0,1] (1,5] (5,8] (8,18] [18,28] (28,43] (43,+\u221e)\nRecovery time (days) [163,345] [555,714] [344,400] [181,204] [82,92] [56,61] [48,55]\nTable 3: Age-dependent time for infected humans to recover\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3: (a) The mortality rate \u03bdhcomputed such that distribution of deaths due to malaria, according\nto the time since infection, follows the Gaussian law \u03a6 \u03bd. (b) The recovery rate \u03b3hdepends both on the\nage and on the time since infection of the infected human. It is computed so that the distribution follows\na Gaussian distribution such that 95 % of the recovery occurs within the ranges showed in Table 3.\nFigure 4: The probability to remain infected depending on the time post-infection and the chronological\nage at the time of the infection.\n3.1.3 Human transmission probability\nAnother crucial parameter in the human transmission is the probability for a mosquito to get infected\nwhile taking a blood meal on a infected human. For each mosquito bite, we suppose that the probability\nthat a human of age aand infected for \u03c4days, transmit the infection to the biting mosquito is \u03b2h(a, \u03c4).\nSuch a probability is known to be strongly linked to the gametocytes density [3, 5, 8, 14, 16, 20]. We\ndenote by G(a, \u03c4) the gametocytes density of an infected human of age a, after \u03c4days of infection. As in [8]\n(see also [3, 5]), we assume that the relationship between gametocyte density G(a, \u03c4) and the probability\n7of transmission from infected human \u03b2h(a, \u03c4) is given by:\n\u03b2h(a, \u03c4) =\u03b11(G(a, \u03c4))\u03b12\nwhere \u03b11= 0.071[0 .023,0.175] and \u03b12= 0.302[0 .16,0.475]. Moreover, we assume that the gametocytes\ndensity follows the function\nG(a, \u03c4) =\u001aG0(a)\u00d7f(\u03c4\u22128) if \u03c4 >8,\n0 otherwise ,\nwhere G0(a) is the mean number of gametocytes for a human of age aand the function fdefined by\nf:x7\u2212\u2192\u03be+ (\u03c8x\u2212\u03be) exp(\u2212\u03c9x)\nwith some parameters \u03be, \u03c8and\u03c9, gives the evolution of the gametocyte density. It was used in [14] to\nestimate the function G0as\nG0(a) =\u03c8aexp(\u2212\u03c9a),\nwhere \u03be= 0 and \u03c8, \u03c9were respectively estimated to 22 .7[17,32] and 0 .0934[0 .08,0.11].\nFinally, the evolution of gametocyte density is fitted on data from 12 patients [20], that were normalized\nsuch that the maximum of each gametocyte density is one, due to the variance between individuals.\nNote that the function fdefined above can be decomposed into the sum of a Gamma distribution\nwith a multiplying factor x7\u2212\u2192\u03c8xexp(\u2212\u03c9x) and an Ivlev function x7\u2212\u2192\u03be(1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03c9x)). While the\nformer function captures the shape of the gametocyte density within the first 40 days after infection given\nby the data, the latter function captures the limit density as xgoes to infinity, since it tends to \u03be. This is\nnot possible with common distribution law since the function vanishes as x increases. This is particularly\nimportant as Plamodium falciparum infections may persist for a long time (see [4]). We estimate \u03be, \u03c8and\n\u03c9respectively to 0 .04[\u22120.27,0.24], 0 .25[0.23,0.27] and 0 .10[0.086,0.124] for time post-infection larger than\n8 days, see Figure 5 (a). The evolution of the gametocyte density Gcan then be computed, see Figure 5\n(b). Finally, the probability \u03b2h(a, \u03c4) of infection from humans with of age aand\u03c4days post-infection is\nillustrated by Figure 6.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 5: (a) The evolution of normalized gametocytemia within human population. (b) The evolution\nof gametocytemia per \u00b5L of blood within human population according to the time post-infection and\nhumans age.\n8Figure 6: The probability that an infected human contaminates a mosquito depending on the time post-\ninfection and the human age.\n3.1.4 Age-dependence of the human transmission capability\nWith these notations and estimates, we see that the human transmission capability Rh\u2192m\n0 can be rewrit-\nten according to the probability to remain infected \u03c0i\nh, the human transmission probability \u03b2hand the\nproportion Phof human of each age as follows:\nRh\u2192m\n0 =Z\u221e\n0Ph(a)Z\u221e\n0\u03b2h(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u03c0i\nh(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4da.\nIn order to see how this quantity depends on the chronological age, we plot the function\na7\u2212\u2192Ph(a)Z\u221e\n0\u03b2h(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u03c0i\nh(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4\n(Figure 7 (a)), as well as the proportion for each group of age (Figure 7 (b)). We see that more than\nhalf of the human transmission capability comes from the younger population (less than 15 years old).\nMoreover, we can compare the impact of the change of demographic structure of the human population,\nmentioned in Section 3.1.1. To this end, we replace Ph(a) bySh,0(a)R\u221e\n0Sh,0(s)dsthat was the proportion of\nhumans for each age in 2012 (see Figure 2 (c)). We see that the capability of people under 30 years old\ndecreases drastically, reducing the total capability by one-third; while the changes in proportion for each\ngroup of age are less pronounced.\n3.2 Mosquito transmission capability\n3.2.1 Mosquito survival\nAs discussed in [47], data suggest that mosquitoes do senesce, which means that the assumption of\nconstant mortality rate for mosquitoes, widely used in the malaria modelling literature, is not realistic\nand may lead for example to an underestimation of the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets [25].\nWhile different shapes of functions (Gompertz, logistic) were compared in [47], the logistic function were\n9(a) (b)\nFigure 7: (a) The contribution of each group of age to the human transmission capability and (b) the\nproportion for each contribution.\nthereafter considered in [40] in their age-structured model. Here, we make use of the data collected in a\nrecent work [46] over 295 mosquitoes of age between 4 and 46 (we note here that we neglected the death\nof the 10 last mosquitoes which occurred after day 46 to have better estimates). The mortality rate \u02dc \u00b5m(a)\nof uninfected mosquitoes of age afor this experiment is such that (Figure 8 (a))\n\u02dc\u00b5m(a) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3c1 ifa\u2208[0,4],\nc1ec2(a\u22124)ifa\u2208[4,45],\nc1e41c2 ifa\u226545,\nwith c1\u22487.85\u00d710\u22123[0.0036,0.0144] and c2\u22488.65\u00d710\u22122[0.0693,0.1076] where we considered constant\nmortality rate below 4 days old and above 45 days old. In Figure 8 (b) we represented the survival\nprobability after 4 days, that is the function [4 ,45]\u220ba7\u2212\u2192exp(\u2212Ra\n4\u02dc\u00b5m(\u03c3)d\u03c3).\nWith such an experimental mortality rate \u02dc \u00b5m, the mean life expectancy is about 27 .4 days correspond-\ning to laboratory conditions. However, the mean life expectancy of wild mosquitoes is in practice hard\nto estimate. While some modelling papers considered a mean life expectancy of 14 days [40] or even 30\ndays [10], the data actually show a large variability between different genus [32] or even between species\n[32, 35]. Even within the species complex Anopheles gambiae s.l. , whose members are major vectors in\nBurkina Faso, lead to an important variability: between 3.6 and 15.4 days [12] or between 4.4 and 10.3\ndays [32]. Reasons for this variability include the effects of seasons and temperature on mosquito survival\n[2], predation, exposure to insecticides, and methods of survival estimation [35]. Hence, we will adjust\nthe mortality rate \u02dc \u00b5mby considering\n\u00b5m=\u00b5wild+ \u02dc\u00b5m\nwith a varying constant \u00b5wild, in order to keep the same shape and to have a mean life expectancy of\nwild susceptible mosquitoes varying between 3 days to 27.4 days that is the experimental life expectancy.\nWe indeed assume that the survival of wildlife mosquitoes is lower than that of experimental mosquitoes\nfor the reasons listed above (season, temperature, insecticides, predation). We can then observe the\nsurvival probability \u03c0s\nm(a) = exp\u0000\n\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(\u03c3)d\u03c3\u0001\nassociated to the different mortality rates in Figure 9\n(a). One component of the mosquito transmission capability is the proportion of mosquitoes of age aat\nthe disease-free equilibrium, that is:\nPm(a) =\u03c0s\nm(a)R\u221e\n0\u03c0sm(s)ds.\nWe can observe in Figure 9 (b) the age distribution of the mosquitoes where almost two-third are less\nthan the life expectancy for each value.\n10(a) (b)\nFigure 8: The mortality rate of experimental mosquitoes older than 4 days is fitted with a Gompertz\nfunction by using data from [46] over 295 mosquitoes (a). We then deduce their probability of survival\n(b).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 9: (a) The survival probability of uninfected mosquitoes according to the chronological age and\nfor different values of \u00b5wildresulting on different values of life expectancy. (b) The cumulative sum of the\nproportionRa\n0Pm(s)dsof mosquitoes for each chronological age according to the life expectancy.\n3.2.2 Survival probability of infected mosquitoes\nFor infected mosquitoes, while the infection does not seem to affect the survival of mosquitoes infected\nwhen they are young (4 days old) or middle-aged (8 days old), it seems to have a significant effect on\nthe old mosquitoes survival [46]. Consequently, the experimental mortality rate \u02dc \u03bdm(a, \u03c4) of an infected\nmosquito of age aand\u03c4days post-infection is such that (Figure 10 (a))\n\u02dc\u03bdm(a, \u03c4) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\u02dc\u00b5m(a) if a\u2265\u03c4, a\u2212\u03c4 <12,\nc1ec2\u03c4ifa\u2265\u03c4, a\u2212\u03c4\u226512, \u03c4\u226429\nc1e29c2ifa\u2265\u03c4, a\u2212\u03c4\u226512, \u03c4 > 29\n0 otherwise\nwith c1\u22484.86\u00d710\u22123[0.00056 ,0.0204] and c2\u22481.45\u00d710\u22121[0.085,0.253]. In Figure 10 (b), we repre-\nsented the survival probability of infected mosquitoes after 12 days, that is the function [12 ,45]\u220ba7\u2212\u2192\nexp(\u2212Ra\n12\u03bdm(\u03be, \u03be\u221212)d\u03be). As above, we adjust the mortality rate \u02dc \u03bdmby considering\n\u03bdm=\u00b5wild+ \u02dc\u03bdm.\n11We then define the survival probability of mosquitoes infected at age afor\u03c4days post-infection by\n\u03c0i\nm(a, \u03c4) = exp\u0012\n\u2212Z\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(\u03be+a, \u03be)d\u03be\u0013\nwhich is equivalent to the probability to remain infected since, once the mosquito salivary glands become\ninvaded by the parasite sporozoites, there is no possible recovery for mosquitoes and they likely remain\ninfectious for life [24]. For each time post-infection, we see that the probability decreases as the age at\nwhich mosquitoes got infected increases between 0 and 12 days, which would not occur with constant\nmortality rate, though this is less pronounced when the life expectancy decreases. Note here that by life\nexpectancy we refer to the one of susceptible mosquitoes that will never be infected, which is not the one\nof mosquitoes older than 12 days when they get infected. Indeed, the mosquitoes infected after 12 days,\nsurvive better than the one infected younger. This is due to a lower mortality rate and is discussed in\n[46]. Nevertheless, the lack of data forced us to suppose that the mortality rate of mosquitoes infected\nafter 12 days only depends on the time post-infection and not on the chronological age, leading to the\nsame probability of remaining infected, though the probability for the mosquitoes to have survived old\nenough until being infected may be rather low, depending on the life expectancy (Figure 11).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 10: The mortality rate of experimental infected mosquitoes older than 12 days is fitted with a\nGompertz function by using data from [46] over 87 mosquitoes (a). We then deduce their probability of\nsurvival (b).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 11: The probability for the mosquitoes to remain infected \u03c0i\nmis represented for (a) \u00b5wild= 0 and\n(b)\u00b5wild= 0.07 for a life expectancy respectively of 27 .4 and 11 .4 days.\n123.2.3 Mosquito to human transmission probability\nThe parasite transmission probability \u03b2mfrom mosquitoes to humans can be computed by using data\nfrom [13, 46]. In [46], the authors follow a cohort of infected mosquitoes along their infection and get\nCq-values, the number of cycles of quantification from qPCR (Figure 12 (a)). The number of sporozoites\nSpz(\u03c4) according to the time since infection \u03c4is computed by using the following log transformation\nSpz(\u03c4) = 10\u2212(Cq(\u03c4)\u221240)/3.3. (8)\nThis transformation takes into account the maximal number of cycles: 40 (see [46]) leading to a zero\nprobability to have sporozoites for a higher number of amplification cycles. The coefficient 3.3 comes\nfrom the negative slope of the linear relationship between the number of cycles of quantitification Cqand\nthe common logarithm of the density of sporozoites [48] leading to\n40\u22123.3 log10(Spz( \u03c4)) =Cq(\u03c4)\nwhence the formula (8). We then fitted the density of sporozoites with a gamma distribution (Figure 12\n(b)), that is:\nSpz(\u03c4) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f30 if \u03c4\u22648\nC(\u03c4\u22128)k\u22121exp\u0010\n\u2212(\u03c4\u22128)\n\u03be\u0011\n\u0393(k)\u03bek otherwise(9)\nwhere Cis the mean number of sporozoites, \u03bethe rate and kthe shape of the gamma distribution. We\nfind with C\u224816605[12873 ,21399], k\u224810.44[6.18,17.04] and \u03be\u22480.76[0.44,1.42]. Moreover, in [46], the\nauthors found that the intensity of sporozoites depends on the age of the mosquito with mean Cq-values at\n14 days post-infection of 27.46 [27.11,27.81] for 12 day-old mosquitoes, 26.65 [26.33,26.97] for 8 day-old and\n25.9 [25.63,26.17] for 4 day-old. We then use the transformation (8) to rescale the gamma distribution (9)\nwith the corresponding mean number of sporozoites. Next, according to [13], the link between the number\nof sporozoites Spz and the probability of parasite transmission from infected mosquitoes to humans \u03b2m\nis such that \u03b2m=\u03balog10(Spz) + \u03b6, where \u03ba\u22480.186[0 .115,0.257] and \u03b6\u22480.08[0,0.25] (Figure 13 (a)).\nConsequently, we assume that the probability \u03b2mis given by the following equation (see Figure 13 (b))\n\u03b2m(a, \u03c4) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f30 if \u03c4\u22648 ora\u2212\u03c4 <0\nmax(0 ,0.186\u00d7log10\u0010\n111119( \u03c4\u22128)9.44e\u2212(\u03c4\u22128)/0.76\n\u0393(10.44)\u00d70.7610.44\u0011\n+ 0.08) if \u03c4 >8,0\u2264a\u2212\u03c4 <8\nmax(0 ,0.186\u00d7log10\u0010\n65842( \u03c4\u22128)9.44e\u2212(\u03c4\u22128)/0.76\n\u0393(10.44)\u00d70.7610.44\u0011\n+ 0.08) if \u03c4 >8,8\u2264a\u2212\u03c4 <12\nmax(0 ,0.186\u00d7log10\u0010\n37413( \u03c4\u22128)9.44e\u2212(\u03c4\u22128)/0.76\n\u0393(10.44)\u00d70.7610.44\u0011\n+ 0.08) if \u03c4 >8, a\u2212\u03c4\u226512(10)\nNote that the probability is taken as zero for time post-infection less than 8 days, due to the latent or\nincubation period within mosquitoes, called the extrinsic incubation period (EIP).\n3.2.4 Human feeding rate and mosquito/human ratio\nThe human feeding rate, denoted by \u03b8is defined as the expected number of bites on humans per mosquito\nper day. An estimation of this rate is complicated to find in the literature and varies for example between\n0.13 [58] and 0.44 [37] for Anopheles gambiae s.l. . Other estimations can be found in [11] and the references\ntherein. For this reason, we will keep this rate variable.\nAnother important quantity appearing in the computation of the basic reproduction number is the\nratio between mosquitoes and humans. First, the mosquitoes recruitment rate \u039b mwill be assumed\nvariable. Moreover, while the human mortality rate \u00b5mis well-known in Burkina Faso (see Section 3.1.1)\nand can be assumed not to vary with time, the human recruitment rate \u039b his supposed constant even if\nthe population in Bobo Dioulasso will increase implying a growth of the recruitment rate. Nevertheless,\n13(a) (b)\nFigure 12: (a) Cq-values of infected mosquitoes along the infection and (b) number of sporozoites during\nthe infection.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 13: (a) The probability of infection according to the number of sporozoites in log-scale and (b) the\nprobability of infection \u03b2maccording to the time post-infection and the age of mosquitoes when infected.\none may assume that this quantity will at some point settle down and give the same age-structure in the\ndemography as shown in Figure 2 (c). The variability in the parameter \u039b hcan then be taken into account\nthrough another parameter, denoted by Cvarsuch as\nCvar=\u03b82\u039bm\n\u039bh.\n3.2.5 Age-dependence of the mosquito transmission capability\nWe note here that the variability in the human and mosquito transmissions \u03b2h, \u03b2mcan also be taken\ninto account, up to a multiplying factor, through the constant Cvarleading to a mosquito transmission\ncapability Rm\u2192h\n0 that can be rewritten as:\nRm\u2192h\n0 =Cvar\u0012R\u221e\n0\u03c0s\nm(a)daR\u221e\n0\u03c0s\nh(a)da\u0013\u0012Z\u221e\n0Pm(a)Z\u221e\n0\u03b2m(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u03c0i\nm(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4da\u0013\n.\nFirstly, the mosquito capability transmission requires that the mosquitoes survive the parasite incubation\nperiod. For that purpose, we represented on Figure 14 (a), for each possible age of infection a, the\n14probability to survive until age aand also survive the incubation period, i.e.\u03c0s\nm(a)\u00d7\u03c0i\nm(a,8) according to\nthe life expectancy by varying the parameter \u00b5wild. As expected, the probability to survive the incubation\nperiod increases with the life expectancy (of susceptible mosquitoes) depicting the importance of knowing\nhow long mosquitoes will survive. Also, the older mosquitoes will get infected, the lower is the probability\nto be someday infectious. Finally, as mentioned in Section 3.2.2, we observe a slight increase of the\nprobability to survive the incubation period around the age of infection of 12 days. Secondly, decoupling\nthe mosquito transmission capability over the age by drawing the function\na7\u2212\u2192Pm(a)Z\u221e\n0\u03b2m(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u03c0i\nm(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4\nleads to an important part coming from young mosquitoes, since mosquitoes getting infected old will\nprobably never survive the incubation period (see Figure 14 (b)).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 14: (a) The probability for mosquitoes to survive the incubation period, according to the life\nexpectancy and age of infection. (b) The mosquito transmission capability according to the chronological\nage and the life expectancy with age-dependant mortality rate.\n3.3 On the immunity waning\nThe immunity waning regulates the re-entering flux into the susceptible compartment from the recovered\none. The basic reproduction number does not depend on the rate khsince it considers the spread of\nthe disease from a single primary individual into an otherwise susceptible population, whence without\nrecovered individuals. However, as shown in [39], the threshold leading to either a backward or a forward\nbifurcation depends on kh. It results on the importance of parameterizing the latter rate since malaria is\nendemic in countries such as Burkina Faso. This is hardly understood in practice and different modelling\nexist in the literature. For example, in [12], recovered individuals are considered as still infectious and\nare part of the force of infection. In this case, the rate khdepicts the loss of the clinical immunity\n[30] that protects against sever symptoms, whence recovered individuals cannot die in their model. As\nmentioned in [12], it is generally believed that immunity is short-lived and requires repeated reinfection to\nsustain itself , whence khshould be age-dependent. In the above papers, it is assumed that the period of\nimmunity is either 3.5 years [30] or 5 years [12]. Another example is [40] where infected humans directly\nbecome susceptible instead of being recovered.\n4 Derivation of entomological parameters intervening in malaria trans-\nmission\nThe basic reproduction number and the vectorial capacity which were discussed in the latter section,\nencompass different biological processes (such as mosquito lifespan, human feeding, stability index etc.)\nthat were investigated among others by Smith and McKenzie [43, 44, 45]. We derive here formulas for\nthe age-structured model (3) while details are given in Section 6.\n154.1 Proportion of infected mosquitoes, EIP and sporozoite rate\nThe force of infection from mosquitoes to humans is defined by (1) and can be rewritten as:\n\u03bbm\u2192h(t, a) =Sh(t, a)Nm(t)\nNh(t)Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0\u03b8\u03b2m(s, \u03c4)Im(t, s, \u03c4 )\nNm(t)dsd\u03c4\nwhich reveals the mosquito/human ratio Nh(t)/Nm(t) and the proportion of mosquitoes at time t, that\nhave chronological age sand infection age \u03c4, which is Im(t, s, \u03c4 )/Nm(t). Similarly, the force of infection\nfrom humans to mosquitoes is defined by (2) and includes the proportion of humans at time t, that have\nchronological age sand infection age \u03c4:Ih(t, s, \u03c4 )/Nh(t). We now assume that the solution of model (3)\nconverges to an endemic equilibrium, i.e.\n(Sh(t,\u00b7), Ih(t,\u00b7,\u00b7), Rh(t,\u00b7,\u00b7), Sm(t,\u00b7), Im(t,\u00b7,\u00b7)\u2212\u2192\nt\u2192+\u221e(S\u2217\nh(\u00b7), I\u2217\nh(\u00b7,\u00b7), R\u2217\nh(\u00b7,\u00b7), S\u2217\nm(\u00b7), I\u2217\nm(\u00b7,\u00b7)). (H)\nWe then denote by Ih(a, \u03c4) the ratio of humans of age athat are infected since \u03c4days:\nIh(a, \u03c4) =I\u2217\nh(a, \u03c4)R\u221e\n0S\u2217\nh(a)da+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0I\u2217\nh(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0R\u2217\nh(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4.\nNote thatR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0Ih(s, \u03c4)d\u03c4dsstands for the total proportion of infected humans. We define the proba-\nbility for a mosquito to survive and get infected (for the first time) at age aby\ngm(a) :=\u0012Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s, \u03c4)Ih(s, \u03c4)dsd\u03c4\u0013\n\u03b8e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)dse\u2212\u03b8aR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s,\u03c4)Ih(s,\u03c4)dsd\u03c4.\nSumming over all chronological ages, we get the probability for a mosquito to ever become infected\nasR\u221e\n0gm(a)da,i.e.\n1\u2212Z\u221e\n0\u00b5m(a)e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)ds\u2212\u03b8aR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s,\u03c4)Ih(s,\u03c4)dsd\u03c4da. (11)\nConcerning the infectious mosquitoes, we first need to define the entomological (or extrinsic) incu-\nbation period which is given by\nEIP := inf\u001a\n\u03c4\u22650 :Z\u221e\n0\u03b2m(a, \u03c4)da > 0\u001b\n(12)\nthat corresponds to the smallest infection age \u03c4so that the probability of malaria transmission from\nmosquitoes infected since a duration \u03c4is positive for some chronological ages. In the latter section, it was\nassumed that EIP = 8 as we can observe from (10). For a mosquito infected at age a, it follows that the\nprobability to survive the incubation period reads as\ne\u2212REIP\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212\u03c4,\u03c4)d\u03c4(13)\nwhile the probability for a mosquito to ever become infectious is\nZ\u221e\nEIPgm(a\u2212EIP)e\u2212REIP\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212\u03c4,\u03c4)d\u03c4da. (14)\nAnother important entomological parameter is the sporozoite rate defined as the proportion of mosquitoes\nthat are infectious. This definition assumes that each population is at equilibrium, otherwise the propor-\ntion would be time-depending. Computing the proportion of mosquitoes that are infected , we see\nthat this is simply\nCRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)dsda+CRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4(15)\n16wherein the constant CRis given by\nCR:=\u0012Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0\u03b8\u03b2h(s, \u03c4)Ih(s, \u03c4)dsd\u03c4\u0013\n.\nSimilarly, the sporozoite rate can be computed as follows:\nSr=CRR\u221e\nEIPR\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)dsda+CRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4. (16)\nIn [44], the authors wrote that the sporozoite rate ( i.e., the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious)\nis equivalent to the probability that an individual mosquito ever become infectious . But these are two\nseparate issues. One simple counter-example is when the natural mortality is zero ( i.e.\u00b5m\u22610) and the\nmortality due to the infection is negligible at the beginning of the infection ( i.e.\u03bdm(., s)\u22610\u2200s\u2208[0,EIP])\nbut nonzero otherwise. Then, the probability for any mosquito to become infectious is one (as long as\nCR\u0338= 0), while the proportion of infected mosquitoes is obviously below 1 due to the constant flux of\nnewborn susceptible mosquitoes.\n4.2 Mosquito survival and lifespan\nWe now focus on mosquito survival , defined previously by the function \u03c0s\nm. Computing the survival\nprobability of a random mosquito is quite tricky for the general model formulation since it depends on\nthe time of infection. It then requires to know the proportion of mosquitoes that are infected at each age,\nwhich was computed in the previous section. Here, \u03c0s\nmis derived in absence of infection and thus concerns\nonly mosquitoes that will not be infected. As mentioned before, mosquitoes survival is usually supposed\nnot to be affected by malaria infections, i.e.\u00b5m=\u03bdmwhile our model distinguishes the two mortality\nrates, whence mosquitoes that will be infected at some point of their lifetime, shall have different survival\nfunctions. Using the probability to be infected at each age, we deduce that the probability for a newborn\nmosquito to survive to age ais:\n\u03a0m(a) =\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212\u03b8aR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s,\u03c4)Ih(s,\u03c4)dsd\u03c4+Za\n0gm(a\u2212s)e\u2212Rs\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212\u03c4,\u03c4)d\u03c4ds\nwhile the average lifespan is given by\nZ\u221e\n0a\u0014\n\u00b5m(a)\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212\u03b8aR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s,\u03c4)Ih(s,\u03c4)dsd\u03c4+Za\n0\u03bdm(a, s)gm(a\u2212s)e\u2212Rs\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212\u03c4,\u03c4)d\u03c4ds\u0015\nda. (17)\nThemedian survival time ,i.e.the half-life of the mosquito population is defined as the age athat\nsatisfies\n\u03a0m(a) = 1 /2. (18)\nIn absence of infection, the half-life of the mosquito population that will never be infected satisfies the\nfollowing equality:\n\u03c0s\nm(a) =e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)ds= 1/2\u21d0\u21d2Za\n0\u00b5m(s)ds= ln(2) .\n4.3 Human feeding, stability index and human blood index\nWe now focus on mosquitoes bites, that are the starting point of any infection. It is then crucial to be able\nto estimate the number of bites per mosquito per day, or equivalently, the number of times each human\nis bitten every day. With that in mind, we define the human feeding rate as the expected number of\nbites on humans per mosquito per day. It is here denoted by \u03b8, but is usually decomposed as the product\nof the mosquito feeding rate f\u2013where the inverse stands for the interval between blood meals\u2013 and the\n17proportion of bites that are taken on humans Q, hence \u03b8=fQ. For simplicity we supposed that this rate\ndoes not depend on the mosquito age, even if our framework would allow any age dependence.\nFrom Section 4.2 we know that a mosquito lives on averageR\u221e\n0\u03a0m(a)dadays and bites \u03b8humans\nevery day. It follows that a mosquito bites in average Sihumans over its lifetime, where Siis called the\nstability index and is defined by\nSi=\u03b8Z\u221e\n0\u03a0m(a)da. (19)\nSince the life expectancy depends both on the age and the infection status, for a mosquito infected at age\n\u03be, the average number of bites that it will give after its infection is\n\u03b8Z\u221e\n\u03bee\u2212Rs\n\u03be\u03bdm(w,w\u2212\u03be)dwds,\nwhich is in general not equal to Si. The human blood index (HBI) is defined as the proportion of\nmosquitoes that will ever fed on a human, which we will denote Hin the following. This is given by\nH= 1\u2212R\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8)dsda\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)dsda+CRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4. (20)\nDecomposing the human feeding rate as \u03b8=fQ, one may similarly define the proportion of fed\nmosquitoes , or the proportion of mosquitoes that have ever fed (whether on human or not) as\nHf= 1\u2212R\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+f)dsda\nR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)dsda+CRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4. (21)\nIt is important to report that in the literature (see e.g. [38, 51]), the human blood index refers to the\nproportion of mosquito blood-meals that are of human origin , which is here denoted by Q.\n4.4 Human biting rate, EIR and lifetime transmission potential\nWe focus here on infectious bites. Let us define the mosquito density per human as the ratio between\nthe number of mosquitoes and the number of humans, that reads as\n\u03c1=\u039bm\u0010R\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)dsda+CRR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4\u03b8e\u2212Ra\u2212\u03c4\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8CR)ds\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(a\u2212s,s)dsdad\u03c4\u0011\n\u039bhR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5h(s)dsda\u2212R\u221e\n0Ra\n0\u0000Rs\n0\u03bdh(s, \u03c4)I\u2217\nh(s, \u03c4)d\u03c4\u0001\ne\u2212Ra\ns\u00b5h(\u03be)d\u03bedsda. (22)\nBy definition, we know that each mosquito bites \u03b8times per day. Since the bites does not depend either\non the age or its status infection, it follows that the number of bites per human per day, also called the\nhuman biting rate , is simply\nHBR = \u03c1\u03b8. (23)\nSince the proportion of infectious mosquitoes is Sr, it follows that the number of infectious bites received\nper day by one human, also called the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) , is given by\nEIR = \u03c1\u03b8Sr. (24)\nIt is important to note that if each human indeed receives in average \u03c1\u03b8Srinfectious bites per day, each\ninfectious bite has not the same infective load: Sris just an indicator for the proportion of infectious\nmosquitoes without taking into account the time post-infection nor the age, on which depends the trans-\nmission rate \u03b2m(see Section 3.2.3). Furthermore, we may deduce that each mosquito bites in average\n\u03b8Srhumans every day.\n18Thelifetime transmission potential is then the expected number of new human infections that\nwould be generated by a newly emerged adult mosquito. This is expressed as:\n\u0012\n\u03b8Z\u221e\n0gm(a)Z\u221e\na\u03b2m(s, s\u2212a)e\u2212Rs\na\u03bdm(\u03be,\u03be\u2212a)d\u03bedsda)\u0013\u0012\n1\u2212Z\u221e\n0Z\u221e\n0Ih(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4da\u0013\n(25)\nwhere the first part describes the number of infectious bites given by one mosquito over its lifetime,\ncontaining the probability to be infected at age a(gm(a)) and the number of infectious bites after infection:R\u221e\na\u03b2m(s, s\u2212a)e\u2212Ra\ns\u03bdm(\u03be,\u03be\u2212a)d\u03bedswhere the exponential stands for the survival of the mosquito when\ninfected; while the second part is the proportion of susceptible humans.\n4.5 Comparison to the classical model\nIn the previous literature (see e.g.[44]) those important entomological parameters were derived in absence\nof any structural variables. Here we show that our formulas generalize the ones given in [44] in a particular\ncase, a summary will be given in Table 4. To this end, we first introduce the classical model, i.e.without\nage structure variables by making the following assumption:\nAssumption 4.1 Parameters \u03bdm, \u00b5m, \u03bdh, \u00b5h, kh, \u03b3hand\u03b2hare constant, while \u03b2mis constant piecewise\nfunction: for each a\u22650,\n\u03b2m(a, \u03c4) =(\n0 if\u03c4\u2264EIP\n\u03b2motherwise\nwhere EIP is a constant standing for the entomological incubation period. Moreover, the mosquito and\nhuman mortality does not depend on the status of the infection: \u03bdm=\u00b5m, \u03bdh= 0.\nUnder Assumption 4.1, the PDE model (3) can, after some integration, be rewritten as the following\ndelayed differential system of equations:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3S\u2032\nh(t) = \u039b h+khRh(t)\u2212\u00b5hSh(t)\u2212\u03b8\u03b2mIm(t)Sh(t)\nNh(t)\nI\u2032\nh(t) = \u03b8\u03b2mIm(t)Sh(t)\nNh(t)\u2212(\u00b5h+\u03b3h)Ih(t),\nR\u2032\nh(t) = \u03b3hIh(t)\u2212(\u00b5h+kh)Rh(t),\nS\u2032\nm(t) = \u039b m\u2212\u00b5mSm(t)\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hSm(t)Ih(t)\nNh(t),\nE\u2032\nm(t) = \u03b8\u03b2hSm(t)Ih(t)\nNh(t)\u2212\u00b5mEm(t)\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hSm(t\u2212EIP)Ih(t\u2212EIP)\nNh(t\u2212EIP)e\u2212\u00b5mEIP,\nI\u2032\nm(t) = \u03b8\u03b2hSm(t\u2212EIP)Ih(t\u2212EIP)\nNh(t\u2212EIP)e\u2212\u00b5mEIP\u2212\u00b5mIm(t),(26)\nwhere Sh,Ih,Rhstand for susceptible, infected and recovered human, while Sm,Em,Imrespectively\ndenote susceptible, exposed and infected mosquitoes. We can note that the exposed compartment is\ncomposed of the infected mosquitoes whose incubation period is not finished. In the following, (26) will\nbe referred as the classical model . The basic reproduction number R0for the classical model takes the\nform\nR0=q\nRm\u2192h\n0\u00d7 Rh\u2192m\n0 (27)\nwhere the per bite transmission capability from human to mosquito Rh\u2192m\n0 and the vectorial capacity\nRm\u2192h\n0 now write\nRh\u2192m\n0 =\u03b2h\n\u00b5h+\u03b3h,Rm\u2192h\n0 =\u03b82\u039bm\u03b2m\u00b5he\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u039bh\u00b52m, (28)\nand we recover the classical formula of the vectorial capacity [34, 43]. By estimate (11), the probability\nfor a mosquito to ever become infected for the classical model writes\n\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh,\n19where Ihis the proportion of infected humans (under the static hypothesis (H)). Moreover, by (13), the\nprobability to survive the incubation period for the classical model becomes e\u2212\u00b5mEIP. Finally, by (14),\nthe probability for a mosquito to ever become infectious, for the classical model, is given by\n\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP.\nBy estimates (15) and (16) the proportion of mosquitoes that are infected, for the classical model\nwrites\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh.Similarly, the sporozoite rate for the classical model writes\u03b8\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh.Note that in\nthis case, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infected and the sporozoite rate respectively coincide\nwith the probability for each mosquito to become infected and infectious. However, both quantities are\nexpected to be very different in general. Next, based on estimate (18), the median survival time for the\nclassical model, i.e.the half-life of the mosquito population leads to a=ln(2)\n\u00b5mwhich does not depend on\nthe infection status since \u00b5m=\u03bdm.\nThe human feeding rate (denoted by \u03b8) is the expected number of bites on humans per mosquito per\nday. It is usually decomposed as the product ( \u03b8=fQ) of the mosquito feeding rate fand the proportion\nof bites that are taken on humans Q. Note that, for the classical model, the stability index, defined by\n(19), writes Si=\u03b8\n\u00b5m. We then observe that the life expectancy of a mosquito that has already lived a\ncertain number of days (infected or not) is exactly the same as a recently emerged mosquito (with the\nclassical formulation), that is1\n\u00b5mdays. As a consequence, Smith and McKenzie [44] reinterpreted the\nstability index as the expected number of bites given by a mosquito after it has become infectious. In the\ngeneral case, this reinterpretation is incorrect. Indeed, the life expectancy depends both on the age and\nthe infection status (see Section 4.3). Moreover, with the classical formulation, the human blood index,\ndefined by (20), writes H=\u03b8\n\u00b5m+\u03b8. Similarly, by (21), the proportion of fed mosquitoes, or the proportion\nof mosquitoes that have ever fed (on human or not) for the classical model writes Hf=f\nf+\u00b5m.\nFinally, based on estimates (22), (23), (24) and (25): other quantities (for the classical model for-\nmulation) such as mosquito density per human ( \u03c1), human biting rate (HBR), entomological inocula-\ntion rate (EIR), and lifetime transmission potential are respectively given by \u03c1=\u039bm\u00b5h\n\u039bh\u00b5m, HBR =\u03b8\u039bm\u00b5h\n\u039bh\u00b5m,\nEIR =\u03b82\u039bm\u00b5h\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u039bh\u00b5m(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)and\u03b82\u03b2h\u03b2mIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP(1\u2212Ih)\n\u00b5m(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh).Note that in [44], the second term in the last estimate\ndoes not appear, thus neglecting the human already infected. Indeed, new infections imply necessarily\nupon susceptible individuals.\n20Parameters Classical ODE model PDE model\nBasic reproduction number ( R0)q\n\u03b82\u039bm\u03b2m\u03b2he\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u039bh\u00b52m(\u00b5h+\u03b3h)(6)\nVectorial capacity ( Vc)\u03b82\u039bm\u00b5h\u03b2me\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u039bh\u00b52m(7)\nProbability for a mosquito to become infected\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh(11)\nEntomological incubation period (EIP) EIP(\u2217)(12)\nProbability of surviving incubation period e\u2212\u00b5mEIP(13)\nProbability for a mosquito to become infectious\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP(14)\nProportion of infected mosquitoes\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh(15)\nSporozoite rate ( Sr)\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP(16)\nAverage mosquito lifespan1\n\u00b5m(17)\nMedian mosquito survival timeln(2)\n\u00b5m(18)\nHuman feeding rate fQ(\u2217\u2217)\u03b8\nStability index ( Si)\u03b8\n\u00b5m(19)\nHuman blood index ( H)\u03b8\n\u03b8+\u00b5m(20)\nProportion of fed mosquitoes ( Hf)f\nf+\u00b5m(21)\nDensity of mosquitoes per human ( \u03c1)\u039bm\u00b5h\n\u039bh\u00b5m(22)\nHuman biting rate (HBR)\u03b8\u039bm\u00b5h\n\u039bh\u00b5m(23)\nEntomological inoculation rate (EIR)\u039bm\u00b5h\u03b82\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP\n\u039bh\u00b5m(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)(24)\nLifetime transmission potential\u03b82\u03b2h\u03b2mIhe\u2212\u00b5mEIP(1\u2212Ih)\n\u00b5m(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh).

Quantities such as the basic reproduction number, the\nvectorial capacity and some important entomological parameters can readily be put into equations once\na mathematical framework have been set up. In the previous literature (see e.g. [43, 44, 45]), those\nquantities were derived in a classical case for a differential system of equations (26) i.e.without any\nstructural variable, thus neglecting possible age effects. As discussed in Section 3, literature about model\nparameters clearly show that they depend on both chronological and infection ages of human and mosquito\npopulations. In the same section, we showed how existing data could be exploited to estimate some of\nthe parameters. Even though data are far from sufficient to give quantitative results, it still allows us to\nconfirm the age-dependence of the human infectious reservoir and being rather young, mainly less than\n15 years old (see [15, 21]). Demography is particularly important as a large part of the population of\ncountries such as Burkina Faso is precisely in the age of the major human reservoir. On mosquitoes\nside, structuring in chronological age seems relevant due to the high dependence of the mortality rate in\nage depicting a senescence within Anopheles populations. While the survival of mosquitoes in the field\ncontains high variability due to different external (seasons, temperature) and internal (genus, species)\nreasons as discussed in Section 3.2.1, the lifespan seems however lower than a few weeks. Adding the\nfact that mosquitoes do not get infectious right after infection but only after a variable duration called\nthe EIP, we better understand the necessity to follow both chronological ages and infection ages of the\nmosquito. Indeed, the remaining lifespan of any mosquito depends on the the time already spent, contrary\nto the classical case. Consequently the sooner a mosquito get infected, the higher its vectorial capacity\nis (see Figure 14 (b)). When the mortality is supposed constant, we can observe a similar transmission\ncapability when the life expectancy is lower than 15 days, but differences occur above this value (see\nFigure 15 (a)). This is more visible when we compute the total capability that is, up to a multiplying\nconstant, the vectorial capacity:\nZ\u221e\n0Pm(a)Z\u221e\n0\u03b2m(a+\u03c4, \u03c4)\u03c0i\nm(a, \u03c4)d\u03c4da\n(see Figure 15 (b)). Here we see that for life expectancy higher than 15 days, the transmission capability\nis smaller for each mosquito age resulting to a lower total capability. This can be explained by the\ndifferent age-distribution of mosquitoes at the disease-free equilibrium. In Figure 16 (a) we see that\nthe distribution of mosquitoes death, for susceptible mosquitoes, follows well the data with the age-\ndependent mortality rate while a constant mortality rate overestimates the proportion of mosquitoes that\nwill die young. Consequently, omitting mosquito chronological age in the model may have non negligible\nepidemiological effects. The median mosquito survival time (for susceptibe mosquitoes) also differs with\nthe assumption on the mortality rate, while it is linear with coefficient ln(2) in the constant case, the\nage-dependent case shows a nonlinear increase of the median age (see Figure 16 (b)). As a consequence,\nthe only knowledge of the mosquito lifespan, through the mortality rate in the classical case, is not enough\nto quantify epidemiological parameters of malaria transmission.\n6 Appendix\nHere we give some details about the formulas derived in Section 4. Considering a newborn mosquito, the\nprobability that it will still be alive and not yet infected at age ais\ne\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)ds\n|{z}\n(a)e\u2212\u03b8aR\u221e\n0R\u221e\n0\u03b2h(s,\u03c4)Ih(s,\u03c4)dsd\u03c4\n| {z }\n(b)\nthat is the product of the probability to survive the natural mortality (a) and the probability to not have\nbeen infected earlier (b).

One may observe that Im(s, \u03c4)/Nm, defined above as the proportion of\ninfected mosquitoes with chronological age sand infection age \u03c4, can readily be computed as:\ngm(s\u2212\u03c4)e\u2212R\u03c4\n0\u03bdm(s\u2212u,u)du\nfor each s\u2265\u03c4and is zero otherwise.\nThe proportion of mosquitoes that get infectious at age ais simply the ones that survived then get\ninfected at age a\u2212EIP and also survived the incubation period.

It follows that the probability for a mosquito to survive until age a, knowing that it was infected\nat age \u03be, is given by\n\u03c0m,\u03be(a) =e\u2212R\u03be\n0\u00b5m(s)dse\u2212Ra\n\u03be\u03bdm(s,s\u2212\u03be)ds=\u03c0s\nm(\u03be)e\u2212Ra\n\u03be\u03bdm(s,s\u2212\u03be)ds=\u03c0s\nm(\u03be)\u03c0i\nm(\u03be, a\u2212\u03be)\nfor each age a\u2265\u03be. Note that if a < \u03be then the mosquito dies before being infected and the probability\nto survive until age ais simply \u03c0m(a). We can see that those two terms simply rewrite respectively as\ne\u2212\u00b5m\u03beande\u2212\u03bdm(a\u2212\u03be)in the classical case. It follows that for (26) we have \u03c0m,\u03be(a) =\u03c0s\nm(a) for each \u03be\u22650\nand consequently the mosquito survival does not depend on the age of infection. For newborn mosquito,\nthe probability to survive until age ais \u03a0 m(a) where the left part stands for the survival probability in\nthe susceptible population while the right part is the survival probability in the infected population. One\nmay compute more explicitly this probability in the constant case as:\n\u03a0m(a) =(\ne\u2212a(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)\u0010\n1 +\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIh\u0011\n\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIhe\u2212\u03bdma\n\u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIhif\u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIh\u0338= 0,\ne\u2212(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)a(1 +a\u03b8\u03b2hIh) if \u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIh= 0.\nNote that if the mortality of mosquitoes does not depend on the infection i.e.\u03bdm\u2261\u00b5mas in the classical\ncase, or if the proportion of infected humans is zero ( Ih\u22610), then the latter expression becomes exactly\n\u03c0m(a). Following a newborn mosquito that will never be infected, the probability to survive and die at\nageais\u00b5m(a)\u03c0s\nm(a) while the average lifespan ,i.e.the expected waiting time to death or the mean\nlife expectancy, is defined as\nZ\u221e\n0a\u00b5s\nm(a)\u03c0m(a)da=Z\u221e\n0\u03c0s\nm(a)da=Z\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)dsda\nwhich is equal to 11\n\u00b5min the classical case. On the other hand, the average lifespan of mosquitoes that\nwill be infected at age \u03be, is\nZ\u03be\n0a\u00b5m(a)\u03c0s\nm(a)da+Z\u221e\n\u03bea\u03bdm(a, a\u2212\u03be)\u03c0m,\u03be(a)da=Z\u221e\n0e\u2212Rmin{\u03be,a}\n0\u00b5m(s)dse\u2212Ra\nmin{\u03be,a}\u03bdm(s,s\u2212\u03be)dsda\nwhich amounts to\n1\n\u00b5m+e\u2212\u00b5m\u03be\u00121\n\u03bdm\u22121\n\u00b5m\u0013\nin the constant case that is again1\n\u00b5mwhenever \u00b5m=\u03bdm. We can observe that this quantity is larger\nthan1\n\u00b5mif and only if \u00b5m> \u03bd mmeaning that infected mosquitoes will live in average longer than\nsusceptible mosquitoes if and only if the mortality rate of the infected population is smaller than the one\nof the susceptible population. Considering the probability to be infected at each age, we deduce that the\naverage lifespan is given by (17) and is equal to\n(\u00b5m\n(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)2+\u03b8\u03b2hIh\n\u03bdm(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)2(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh+\u03bdm) if \u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIh\u0338= 0,\n\u00b5m\n(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)2+2\u03b8\u03b2h\u03bdmIh\n(\u00b5m+\u03b8\u03b2hIh)3 if\u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m\u2212\u03b8\u03b2hIh= 0\n24in the constant case (or1\n\u00b5munder Assumption 4.1). For mosquitoes that are infected at age \u03be, the median\nsurvival time is defined by the age asuch as\ne\u2212Rmin{\u03be,a}\n0\u00b5m(s)dse\u2212Ra\nmin{\u03be,a}\u03bdm(s,s\u2212\u03be)ds= 1/2\u21d0\u21d2Zmin{\u03be,a}\n0\u00b5m(s)ds+Za\nmin{\u03be,a}\u03bdm(s, s\u2212\u03be)ds= ln(2)\nwhich amounts to\na=(ln(2)\n\u00b5mif\u03be >ln(2)\n\u00b5m,\nln(2)+ \u03be(\u03bdm\u2212\u00b5m)\n\u03bdmif\u03be\u2264ln(2)\n\u00b5m\nin the constant case (and stillln(2)\n\u00b5min the classical case). This distinction can be explained as follows: if\nthe mosquitoes are infected relatively old ( \u03be >ln(2)\n\u00b5m) then only the mortality rate of susceptible mosquitoes\nis relevant for the computations since half of the mosquitoes will be already dead before being infected.\nOn the other hand, if the mosquitoes are infected relatively young ( \u03be\u2264ln(2)\n\u00b5m) then the computations take\nalso into consideration the mortality rate of infected mosquitoes. We can observe that if \u00b5m\u2265\u03bdmthen\nthe median life time ais larger thanln(2)\n\u00b5m, meaning that the infected mosquitoes survive better than the\nnon infected ones. A contrario , if\u00b5m\u2264\u03bdmthen a\u2264ln(2)/\u00b5mand susceptible mosquitoes survive better\nthan infected mosquitoes. Let us consider a susceptible mosquito aged of adays, then its life expectancy\nin absence of infection is\nE(a) :=Z\u221e\nae\u2212Rs\na\u00b5m(w)dwds.\nWe can note that for a recently emerged mosquito ( a= 0) we recover the average lifespan given earlier.\nFor a mosquito that is aged of adays and that get infected at age \u03be(in the past if a\u2265\u03be, or in the future\nifa < \u03be ), its life expectancy is defined by\nE\u03be(a) :=Z\u221e\nae\u2212R\u03be\nmin{a,\u03be}\u00b5m(w)dwe\u2212Rs\nmax{a,\u03be}\u03bdm(w,w\u2212\u03be)dwds.\nAs a consequence, the number of bites given by a mosquito after it has become infectious, clearly depends\non the age at which the mosquito got infected.\nIn [44], the authors defined the human blood index as the proportion of mosquitoes that will ever fed\non a human and gave the following formula\nH=R\u221e\n0\u03c0s\nm(a)(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b8a)daR\u221e\n0\u03c0m(a)da\nwhere they explained that \u03c0s\nm(a)(1\u2212e\u2212\u03b8a) is the proportion of mosquitoes that have survived to age a\nand bitten a human. However, since mosquito survival depends on the infection status, it follows that the\nlatter proportion must depend on when the mosquitoes have bitten a human and whether the bite was\ninfectious or not. It then writes as the ratio between the number of mosquitoes that never have bitten\nany human, with the total number of mosquitoes. This corresponds to:\nH= 1\u2212\u039bmR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+\u03b8)dsdaR\u221e\n0S\u2217m(a)da+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4I\u2217m(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4\nthat is equivalent to (20). Similarly, the proportion of fed mosquitoes is defined by\nHf= 1\u2212\u039bmR\u221e\n0e\u2212Ra\n0(\u00b5m(s)+f)dsdaR\u221e\n0S\u2217m(a)da+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4I\u2217m(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4\nwhich is equivalent to (21). We can note that the probability for a newborn mosquito to ever bite a\nhuman reads as:\n1\u2212Z\u221e\n0\u00b5m(a)\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212\u03b8ada=Z\u221e\n0\u03b8\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212\u03b8ada.\n25Indeed, the latter expression can readily be explained as the probability \u03c0s\nm(a) for the mosquito to survive\nuntil age athen to die \u00b5m(a)e\u2212Ra\n0\u00b5m(s)dsat age awithout biting any human e\u2212\u03b8a. As a consequence, the\nleft part is simply the opposite of the proportion of mosquitoes that will never bite any human, because\nthey will die before. Concerning the right part, it can also be decomposed as the probability to survive\nuntil age awithout never have bitten any human \u03c0m(s)(a)e\u2212\u03b8aand the proportion, among them, that\nbite a mosquito at the age a, that is \u03b8. It is then simply summed over all ages. We can note in the\nclassical case, we recover the same formula as for H, but not in general. In the same way, the probability\nfor a newborn mosquito to ever fed is simply:\n1\u2212Z\u221e\n0\u00b5m(a)\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212fada=Z\u221e\n0f\u03c0s\nm(a)e\u2212fada.\nWe clearly recover the latter formula when mosquitoes only bite humans ( i.e.Q= 1). In the classical\ncase, we see that the latter proportion is simply the same as for Hf. Finally, the ratio between the\nnumbers of mosquitoes and humans is\n\u03c1=R\u221e\n0S\u2217\nm(a)da+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4I\u2217\nm(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4R\u221e\n0S\u2217\nh(a)da+R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03c4I\u2217\nh(a, \u03c4)dad\u03c4 +R\u221e\n0R\u221e\n\u03b7R\u2217\nh(a, \u03b7)dad\u03b7\nwhich leads, after some computations following [39, Section 7], to (22).\nReferences\n[1] R. \u00b4Aguas, L.

A review  \n \nAndrea Radici1*, Daniele Bevacqua2, Leonardo Miele2, Davide Martinett i1 \n \nAffiliation  1INRAE, UR 546 BioSP, Site Agroparc , 84914 Avignon, France. 2INRAE, UR \n1115 PSH, Site Agroparc, 84914 Avignon, France.  \nAbstract  \nIncreasing cultivated lands, crop homogenization and global food trade have fostered \nthe spread of crop pests and diseases. Optimizing crop protection is urgently needed to \nensure food safety. One aspect of crop protection is surveillance, which focuses on the \nearly detection of a parasite, and control, aiming to fight and possibly eradicate it. \nNetwork theory has been widely used to model the spread of human and an imal \ninfectious diseases in systems described through nodes and edges. It has been \nsuccessfully used to optimize monitoring and immunization campaigns. In crop \nprotection, there is a growing literature using this theory to describe parasites spread \nand to conceive protection strategies.  \nHere we review the use of network theory in crop protection, from the more descriptive \nto the more applied approaches aimed to optimize crop protection. We retrace the \nlogical process that has led epidemiological models to r ely on network theory, and we \nprovide examples of how the spread of crop parasites has been represented via a \nnetwork description. We define the objectives of surveillance and control, and we show \nhow these have been declined in the network -based epidemiol ogical sphere and then \nadapted in the agricultural context. We eventually discuss the discrepancy between the \napplication of network theory in surveillance and control to identify culprits  and \nsolutions.  \nWe find that: i) scientists have successfully interp reted very different modes of parasitic \ntransmission under the lens of network theory; ii) while network -based surveillance \nhas progressively clarified its objectives and sound tools have been proposed, network -\nbased control has been less studied and appli ed; iii) network -thinking must address \nhow to properly define edges and nodes at different geographic scale to broad its \napplication in crop protection.  \nKeywords : crop protection, networks, parasites, epidemic surveillance, epidemic \ncontrol.  \n  \n \n* Contact: andrea.radici@inrae.fr  Contents  \nAbstract

\nproduction at the global scale (Savary et al. 2019) . In the next decades, crop losses are \nexpected to increase due to the narrowing of diversity in crop species and the increase of food demand, pesticide resistance, and of global trade  which determine favorable \nconditions for pests and diseases spread as they increase the host abundance and \ncontact probability between hosts (Carvajal -Yepes et al. 2019; Khoury et al. 2014; \nRistaino et al. 2021a) . Climate change could also faci litate the spread of certain \npathogens and pests (Corredor -Moreno and Saunders 2020)  and most of the losses are \nexpected in countries with expanding populations, where food supply is already an \nissue (Adam 2021; Tilman et al. 2011) . Moreover, agriculture is asked to mitigate its \nenvironmental and health impacts related to the use of chemicals which have been the \nmajor tool to protect crop from pest and disease in the last decades (Tudi et al. 2021; \nVitousek 1994) . The challenge of reconciling sufficient food production with social and \nenvironmental viability is acknowledged as part of the Sustainability Development  \nGoals of the UN 2030 Agenda (Foley et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2016; Tilman et al. 2002) . \nTherefore, surveillance and control, which are complementary measures to protect \ncrops from parasites, hereinafter intended for both pests and pathogens, ought to be \noptimized (Carvajal -Yepes et al. 2019; Morris et al. 2022; Ristaino et al. 2021 ). \nSurveillance, which is mostly based on data collection and analysis, aims to detect the \npresence of parasites early and to know the phytosanitary status of a crop. Control aims \nto reduce parasitic dispersal, either by immunizing hosts, e.g. by cultiv ating resistant \nvarieties, or by limiting parasites dispersal by reducing contacts between individuals. \nAn effective crop protection strategy requires both surveillance and control to work \ntogether: in fact, the efficacy of control measures critically depe nds on the timing of \ndetection of the parasite, which is likely to spread if favorable conditions are present.  \nNetwork theory, originally intended to study properties of systems described by a set of \nnodes connected via edges (Newman 2003) , has been successfully applied to \nepidemiology. In this context, the nodes of the network represent host individuals or \ndistinct host populations and the edges represent connections bet ween nodes. In recent \ndecades, network theory has been extensively used to model the spread of infectious \ndiseases in humans and animals and to inform protection policies (Brockmann and \nHelbing 2013; Dub\u00e9 et al. 2011; Kao et al. 2007; Keeling and Rohani 2011) , the recent \nCovid -19 pandemic being a paradigmatic case (Block et al. 2020; Della Rossa et al. 2020; \nSaunders and Schwartz 2021) . \nNetwork theory has proven to be a valid tool in crop protection to model disease spread \nand to design surveillance and control strategies (Cunniffe et al. 2015; Garrett et al. \n2018; Moslonka -Lefebvre et al. 2011; Parnell et al. 2017) . Unlike animals and humans, \nplants do not move, so that the trans mission of a parasite depends on its displacement. \nThis can be active, such as flying from an orchard to another, or passive, driven by living \nagents (called vectors) or abiotic elements such as air masses, water currents, or even \nvia transport of goods. I n the case of crop parasites, nodes of the network usually \nidentify locations where the host is present, which generally correspond to cultivated \nareas (Fig.  1). \nAn example of network -thinking in crop protection is the identification of those \nlocations tha t contribute the most to spreading parasites (Zhang et al. 2016) . This \nidentification, hereinafter called pr ioritization, is needed because crop protection is \nexpensive, so it is important to rank and select a reduced set of locations (nodes) to be \ninspected for surveillance and/or to be treated for control (as in Fig. 1d). Recently, more \nadvanced research has b een conducted to investigate useful node properties which \nallow this prioritization  (Hernandez Nopsa et al . 2015; Martinetti and Soubeyrand 2019; Sutrave et al. 2012)  in the case of re -emerging parasites, such as Puccinia \ngraminis  (Meyer et al. 2017)  or Xylella fastidiosa  (Strona et al. 2017)  in Europe. The \nimplications of networks for crop protection are rising  (Garrett et al. 2018; Jeger et al. \n2007; Moslonka -Lefebvre et al. 2011; Parnell et al. 2017; Shaw and Pautasso 2014) , but \nlittle research has focused on rigorously clarifying their properties for surveillance and \ncontrol  (Holme 2017) . Also, the level of application of network -thinking is not the same \nin surveillance and control: this review aims to present the state of the ar t in terms of \nnetwork -thinking in crop protection, investigate the main obstacles to applications and \ndelineate research perspectives.  \n \nFig. 1  \u2013 A network of scattered fields over which crop protection is  conducted . a) Fields of \ninterest are part of a com plex landscape; b) in this example, we imagine that the reddish \nfields play as nodes, and that that parasites can move from a field to an adjacent one (via \nan edge); c) the network is formalized  into a graph made of a set of nodes connected via \nedges, disc arding all the trivial elements (only the river is represented in the background \nto help readability); d) control of node 22 (via cultivation of resistant cultivars and/or \nphytosanitary treatment) prevents parasitic flow in and throw this node: its edges a re \ntherefore removed. The presence of parasites in the network is acknowledged via \nsurveillance of nodes 6, 18 and 28 (this latter, for example, allows to indirectly monitor \nconnected nodes 26 and 27).  \n2 Networks: definitions and properties  \nNetworks are set s of nodes connected via edges  (B\u00f6rner et al.  2007) . In epidemiology, \nnodes represent hosts (individuals or populations), while edges represent infectious  \ncontacts. A classic way to represent a network is a square matrix \ud835\udc16, called adjacency \nmatrix, whose generic element \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 represents the edge connecting node \ud835\udc56 to node \ud835\udc57. \nEdges can be either binary ( \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57=1\u22280) or associated to weights, generally positive \n(\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57\u2208\u211d+); either undirected, if a relation from a node \ud835\udc56 to a node \ud835\udc57 implies the same \nfrom \ud835\udc57 to \ud835\udc56 (it follows that the adjacency matrix is symmetric: \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57=\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc56) or directed; \nlastly, they can be dynamic (edges arrangement an d weight vary with time) or static. \nNodes can be characterized in terms of their features, which are quantified via metrics \n(often called centralities). The simplest metric that one can build is the degree, usually \nindicated by \ud835\udc58, i.e. the number of edges  connected to a node. In the case of weighted \nnetworks, the notion of degree is usually replaced by that of strength, i.e. the sum of the \nweights of the edges connected to a node. In the case of directed networks, it can be \nfurther distinguished between in - and out -degree/strength, considering only in - or out -\ngoing edges. The probability distribution of \ud835\udc58 in a given network is called degree \ndistribution, and its average is indicated as \ud835\udc58\u0305. The degree distribution can be used to \nclassify network properties as a whole. For instance, homogeneous networks are built \nin such a way that all nodes have the same degree \ud835\udc58\u0305. On the other hand, the Barab\u00e1si -\nAlbert algorithm allows to build scale -free networks  (Barab \u00e1si and Albert  1999) , in \nwhich the degree distribution follows a power law.  \nSeveral node metrics can be defined  (Mastin et al.  2020) , such as the betweenness of a \nnode \ud835\udc64, i.e., the number of shortest path connecting whatever couple of nodes of the \nnetworks \ud835\udc56 and \ud835\udc57 and passing through \ud835\udc64 (Barab\u00e1si  2016) . Interested readers could find \nan exhaustive summary of node metrics in  L\u00fc et al. (2016) . \n3 Modelling epidemics  \nMathematical epidemiological modelling has its origin in the S -I compartmental model  \n(Kermack et al.  1927) . In its simplest formulation, this assumes that a population is \ndivided into susceptible (S) and infec ted (I) individuals and describes its temporal \nvariation via a system of differential equations:  \n{\ud835\udc46\u0307=\u2212\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3c+\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc3c\n\ud835\udc3c\u0307=\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc3c\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc3c (1) \nWhere \ud835\udefd represents the disease transmission rate, that drives S to become I, and \ud835\udf07 \nrepresents the recovery rate, that drive s I to return to S. This model can be extended to \ninclude other processes ( e.g. immunity, natural mortality and fertility) and it allows to \ndefine the basic reproductive number \ud835\udc450, which indicates \"the expected number of \nsecondary cases which one case wou ld produce in a completely susceptible population\"  \n(Dietz  1993) . In the model described by Eq.  2, \ud835\udc450 is: \n\ud835\udc450=\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf07 (2) \nIf \ud835\udc450 of a d isease is greater than 1, the introduction of an infected individual into a fully \nsusceptible population will cause the spread of the disease, otherwise it will \nprogressively die out. This model assumes homogeneous mixing, which means that \nindividuals have  equal probabilities of transmitting the disease to everybody else. This \nis not the case, for example, when the spatial location of individuals defines their \ncontact structure, which can be formally represented by a network  (Pastor -Satorras et \nal. 2015) . In that case, classic results of epidemic theory may not apply  (Pellis et al.  \n2015) . \nMoreover, networks can embed SI dynamics. In a time -discrete framework, a node can \nbe either susceptible or infected; at each time step \ud835\udeff, each infected node \ud835\udc56 can infect its \ud835\udc58 \nneighbors at a probability \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff, and recove r with a probability \ud835\udf07\ud835\udeff. For instance, in SI dynamics on homogeneous networks it can be shown (Boccaletti et al.  2006)  that Eq.  2 \nis modified into:  \n\ud835\udc450=\ud835\udc58\u0305\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udf07 (3) \nSo \ud835\udc450 depends explicitly on the network via the average degree \ud835\udc58\u0305. For non -\nhomogeneous networks, \ud835\udc450 can be recomputed (Boccaletti et al.  2006)  instead as:  \n\ud835\udc450=\ud835\udc582\u0305\u0305\u0305\u0305\ud835\udefd\n\ud835\udc58\u0305\ud835\udf07 (4) \nWhere \ud835\udc582\u0305\u0305\u0305 is the 2nd moment of the degree distribution of the network. It  has been \nshown that, for epidemic processes in scale -free networks, \ud835\udc582\u0305\u0305\u0305 tends to infinite (Pastor -\nSatorras and Vespignani  2001) : the disease will spread due to the network topology \nprovided a transmission rate \ud835\udefd>0 (Jeger et al.  2007; Shaw a nd Pautasso  2014) . Eq.s 3 \nand 4 suggest that network -related control strategies can help decreasing \ud835\udc450 below 1 by \nacting on the network structure.  \n4 Crop -parasite interactions in a network framewo rk \nIn crop epidemiology, plants are connected via parasitic dispersal  (Shaw and Pautasso  \n2014) . Parasites can move over extremely long distances through different means (air, \nwater, soil, insects;  Aylor  2017; Jordano  2017 ) or can be assisted by human activities  \n(Garrett et al.  2018; Harwood et al.  2009; Hulme  2009; Santini et al.  2018) . The \ndefini tion of the network depends on the scale and mechanism of the contacts  (Garrett \net al.  2018; Gilligan  2008; Shaw and Pautasso  2014) . Below is a list of examples on how \nnetworks have been used to represent and study crop -parasite interactions.  \n4.1  Vector -transmitted parasites  \nStrona et al. (2017)  studied the spread of the pathogenic bacteria X. fastidiosa  in an \nolive -orchard -dominated landscape, via its main European  vector, the meadow \nspittlebug Philaenus spumarius  (Martelli et al.  2016) . They considered olive orchards as \nnodes, which are connected by an edge if they are within 1 km \"between the two closest \nsides\", since observations suggested that this is the order of magnitude of adult \nspittlebug daily flights. They obtained a binary network, since edges are not associated \nto a weight, and undirected, since connection among two orchards are always \nreciprocal. Instead,  de la Fuente et al. (2018)  built a more complex network by \nmodelling the spread of the alien nematode Bursaphe lenchus xylophilus , causal agent of \npine wilt disease, via the longhorn beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis . They \nconsidered coniferous forests as nodes connected via weighted, directed and time -\nvarying edges. Each edge represents the yearly probability of  transmission of the \ndisease from node \ud835\udc56 to node \ud835\udc57, whose weight decreases with the distance between \ud835\udc56 and \n\ud835\udc57 and increases with the assumed number of nematodes in \ud835\udc56 in the previous year.  \n4.2  Wind -dispersed  \nSutrave et al. (2012)  studied a networ k of soybean fields in the US, susceptible to the \nairborne pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi , obtaining a similar network to that of de la \nFuente et al. (2018) . In this model, each node represents an administrative county, while each edge\u2019s intensity is determined by the daily average wind intensity and \ndirection, increases with the dens ity of soybean in the connected nodes, and decreases \nwith the distance. In this case, the network is weighted, directed (because of the \nprevailing wind direction) and dynamic. Enlarging the scale to the continental one, \nMeyer et al. (2017)  used Lagrangian simulation of air masses to model the airborne \ndispersal of the fungal pathogen P. graminis , causal agent of stem rust of wheat, among \nAfrican and Asian countries. Countries play as nodes, while the daily mean proportion of \nairborne spores successfully transmitted from a country to another define the weighted \nand directed edges.  \n4.3  Human -mediated  \nA recent study by Andersen et al. (2019)  models the spread dynamics of a hypothetical \npathogen affecting sweet potato on a netwo rk accounting for local seed trade in Uganda. \nIn such networks, nodes are provided by economic actors or their grouping (sellers, \nvillages), whose interaction, in this case \"at least one transaction during the growing \nseason\", represent directed edges. Hernandez Nopsa et al. (2015)  used the railway \nnetworks in the US (and Australia) to mod el the potential spread of arthropods between \ngrain elevators used to store wheat. In their framework, sets of elevators located in the \nsame state play as nodes, while directed and weighted edges are proportional to the \nvolume of wheat moved from a state t o another via railway, which traditionally account \nfor more than 70% of the shipped wheat in the US.  \n4.4  Multi -mechanism  \nEventually, networks may also summarize multiple mechanisms involved in parasitic \nspread  (Garrett et al.  2018) . For instance, nodes may either be farms, where crop s are \nproduced, or warehouses, where crops are stored after harvesting (Fig.  2). Edges, \nrepresenting possible pathways of parasitic spread, can be subdivided into retail sub -\nnetwork, representing purchase, and landscape sub -network, representing physical \nmovement by wind (or insects or animals). Retail sub -network may be undirected, \nworking both ways between producers and retailers via returnable shipping crates, \nwhile landscape sub -network may have a fixed direction, because of prevalent wind.   \nFig. 2  \u2013 A multi -mechanism epidemic network. Nodes are either farms, where crop is \nproduced, or warehouses, where harvested crop is stoked. Edges, representing possible \nparasite spread pathways, can be subdivided into two sub -networks: retail, representing \npurchase,  and landscape, representing physical movement by wind insects, or animals. \nRetail sub -network is undirected, since it may work both way between producers and \nretailers (for example, via returnable shipping crates), while landscape sub -network has a \nfixed direction, (for example, because of prevalent wind). Network is represented a) as a \ngraph, b) as an adjacency matrix, in which the retail sub -network is symmetric (in blue) \nwhile the landscape one is asymmetric (in green).  \n5 Surveillance  \nSurveillance can be  defined as the \"collection and analysis of information for detection \nand successful control of emerging pathogens\"  (Parnell et al.  2017) . Since this collection \nis expensive, one needs to prioritize a reduced set of locations for monitoring to find \nclues of crop disease emergence.  \n5.1  Prioritize nodes to be monitored  \nIn a network -based surveillance, prioritization of nodes to be monitored (also  referred \nas sentinels) depends on the topology of the network structure. Surveillance may be \ndivided into different objectives  (Herrera et al.  2016; Holme  2018) . For surveillance of \nemerging diseases,  Parnell et al. (2017)  disti nguished between i) detection : \nunderstanding weather a pathogen has arrived in an area, with the minimum possible \ndelay; ii) estimation : estimating the proportion of diseased individuals (incidence) at a \ngiven time; iii) targeting : maximizing the detection  of new cases. These objectives are \nnot pursued without trade -offs. For example, in the case of an already detected parasite, \nincreased \"targeting\" would imply monitoring those nodes which are connected to the \ninfected one, to the detriment of \"estimation\" . In contrast, good \"estimation\" can be \nobtained via homogeneous monitoring, e.g. via random sampling of the entire network, \nbut would result in a worse \"targeting\".  \nDifferent prioritization algorithms allow for the pursuit of different objectives.  Herrera  \net al. (2016 ) compared performances of different algorithms to determine a sentinels \nset in epidemic dynamics on social networks . The criteria for prioritization are: \"most \nconnected\" (nodes characterized by the highest degree); \"random\"; \"random \nacquaint ance\" of random individuals, i.e. a random node connected to a randomly \nextracted node. As expected, sentinels identified via the \"random\" strategy yielded \nindications representative of the overall populations, with early warning close to zero \n(there was n o time lag between the surveillance subset and the entire population to \nreach 1% prevalence) and peak ratios close to one (i.e., peak in incidence was almost \nidentical in the surveillance subset and the entire population). Degree -based strategies, \nsuch as \"most connected\", consistently provided the earliest warnings.  Herrera et al.  \nexplored different network topologies and observed that surveillance performances \ntend to be highly differentiate the less homogeneous the network is.  \n5.2  Techniques for crop survei llance  \nSeveral studies have shown that traditional site prioritization techniques for crop \nsurveillance, based on historical recordings of past epidemics or more complex \napproaches  (Parnell et al.  2017) , may be integrated  (Sanatkar et al.  2015; Sutrave et al.  \n2012)  or even outperformed  (Martinetti and Soubeyrand  2019)  by network metrics.  \nSutrave et al.  (2012 ) explicitly explored network metrics for optimizing surveillance in a \ncontinen tal dynamic network among soybean producing counties. The authors explored \nseveral sentinel prioritization strategies. They observed that surveillance prediction \nerrors were minimized by combining strength and \"infection -frequency\" (a metric \nconsidering pa st presence of the disease). In a recent study, Radici et al. (2022)  \nsimulated worldwide transport of airborne spores of another cereal pathogen, P. \ngraminis , among squared wheat -cultivated cells ( \u2248 2,000 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a2) connected by air -mass \ntrajectories computed via a Lagrangia n model, obtaining a dynamic directed and \nweighted connectivity network. They showed that a surveillance strategy based either \non betweenness or Set cover algorithm (a modified version of in -degree) minimizes the \ndetection delay of simulated outbreaks. Fur thermore, they showed that, given the high \ndensity of the epidemic network, surveillance strategies based on separate subset of \nnodes (representing countries) lead to a sub -optimal allocation of sentinels with respect \nto considering the complete set  of nod es. Network -based prioritization has been also applied in the case human -mediated crop \nparasites.  Andersen et al. (2019) , who studied the spread dynamics of a hypothetical \npathogen affecting sweet potato, suggested that degree and betweenness may behave as \nwell as other more complex metrics in node prioritization. Their importance was \nalready noted in  previous research on arthropods detection in grain networks  \n(Hernandez Nopsa et al.  2015). Similarly , Buddenhagen et al. (2017)  considered a local \nmulti -mechanism potato trade network in Ecuador, and stated that high in -and out -\ndegree nodes were to be surveilled first.  \nRecent research has been conducted to build more complex network metrics and assess \ntheir suitability for surveillance compared to traditional ones. For instance,  Martinetti \nand Soubeyrand, (2019)  followed an approach similar to that of  Herrera et al. (2016)  to \ncompare several surveillance options in the case of X. fastidiosa  in southern France. In \nthis case,  they  divided the region into 1 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a2 cells, which represent nodes of the \nnetwork, while edges\u2019 weights are built on notion of risk : each weight \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc57 is the product \nof a previously computed risk indicator \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc57 in the connected nodes \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57. They tested \nprioritisation techniques based on network metrics (such as k -shell,  Kitsak et al.  2010; \nVoteRank , Zhang et al.  2016 ; generalized random w alk accessibility, or GRWA,  Herrera \net al.  2016 ) and other metrics, such as risk -based and random, to maximi ze the \n\"detection\" ( sensu  Herrera e t al. 2016 ). Strategies based on VoteRank, GRWA and risk -\nbased furnished the earliest detections.  \n6 Control  \nControl can be defined as the set of measures aimed to minimize the disease size or the \noccurrence of losses within a diseased population  (Keeling and Rohani  2011) . Network \nbased epidemic control consists in the preventive re moval of a set of nodes (or of their \nedges) from the epidemic network, in the hope that this will minimize the spread  (Shaw \nand Pautasso  2014) . \n6.1  Prioritize nodes to be removed  \nTraditional disease control methods at the population scale, including vaccines (Keeling \nand Rohani  2011) , may rely on network knowledge. Vaccination levels for reducing \ntransmission usually depend on a threshold determining herd immunity  (Fine  1993) , \nand are in turn calculated via \ud835\udc450. This approach allows a first estimation of the \nimmunization level needed to stem the epidemics in homogeneous networks. As effect \nof the  vaccination of a proportion \ud835\udc54 of the nodes, \ud835\udc450 can be tuned below 1, thus \nextinguishing the spread of the disease (Eq.  5): \n\ud835\udc450=\ud835\udc58\u0305\ud835\udefd(1\u2212\ud835\udc54)\n\ud835\udf07  (5) \nNetwork -based vaccination strategies have been studied to stem epidemics on both \nhuman and animal population s (Rushmore et al.  2014) . It has been shown that \nneglecting highly heterogeneous networks structures may lead to ineffective or \ninefficient immunization strategies  (Jeger et al.  2007) . Identification of the nodes to be \nimmunized via simple metrics, such as node strength, proved to help reducing the \nvaccine coverage threshold, as in the case of wild chimpanzees  (Rus hmore et al.  2014) . \nAlternatively to vaccination, isolation  (Keeling and Rohan i 2011)  may as well target specific nodes ( i.e. isolation of an infected node by removing all its edges) or random \n(i.e. removal of a fraction of edges independently on the nodes health status, such as \nsocial distancing in the case of Covid -19). The fir st case corresponds  to increasing \ud835\udc54, \nequivalently to an immunization or vaccination. In the second case, the strategy affects \n\ud835\udc58\u0305, whose reduction can bring the value of \ud835\udc450 below 1  (Block et al.  2020) . \nSeveral authors highlighted that control strategies should concentrate in immunizing \nhighly connected nodes  (Jeger et al.  2007; Lloyd -Smith et al.  2005; Pastor -Satorras and \nVespignani  2002; Shaw and Pautasso  2014) . In the case of human diseases, targeted \nimmunization proved to achieve good results with rubella and mumps, whose \nheter ogeneous transmission structure possesses scale -free properties  (Pastor -Satorras \nand Vespignani  2001) , rather than  with pertussis, whose transmission structure is more \nhomogeneous  (Trottier and Philippe  2005) . A comprehensive literature exists to \nsupport targeted action against sexually transmitted diseases, based on the scale -free \nproperties of sexual partnership networks  (Jeger et al.  2007) . \nPrioritization methods for targeted removal have been examined according to various \nnetwork metrics, from the simplest (degree, betweenness or closen ess, i.e. the \nreciprocal of the average distance from that node to all the other nodes;  Freeman  1978; \nSabidussi  1966) to more complex (random -walker based methods,  Zhang et al.  2016 ). \nMethods based on k -shell decomposition have proved to produce optimal results \ncompared to classic metrics in identifying influential spreaders  (De Arruda et al.  2014; \nKitsak et al.  2010) , and some generalizations to dynamic networks have been explored  \n(Ciaperoni et al.  2020; Galimberti et al.  2018) . In the specific case of spatial networks, \nwhere weights have the meaning of spatial distance, generalized acc essibility metrics  \n(Traven\u00e7olo and Costa  2008)  have proved to be particularly suitable for targeted \nremoval  (De Arruda et al.  2014) . \nDespite the growing research on network -based disease protection strategies, there is a \nlack of clarification on how to distinguish metrics for determining suitable nodes for \nsurveillance from those suitable for control  (Holme  2017) , which can occasionally \noverlap. Many of the before -mentioned metr ics to prioritize nodes to immunize for \ncontrol are common to those to be detected for surveillance. However, in principle, \nnothing guarantees that an optimal set of sentinels coincides with an optimal set of \ncandidate nodes to be immunized, and vice versa , since surveillance and control are \nlinked to different properties. Fig . 3 shows an example of a SI model running on a \nnetwork, in which in -degree is used to optimize sentinels\u2019  identification and \nbetweenness is used to identify the best node to immunize.   \nFig. 3 \u2013 A network representing potent ial epidemic pathways and strategies based on \nnode metrics to face parasites spread. In panels a) and b) the same SI epidemic process \nstarting from node A (i.e., the inoculated node) is shown. At each time step, each \nsusceptible node becomes infected if it  has at least one infected neighbor pointing to it, \nwithout recovery. In panel a) node E is a sentinel: it easily detects the disease (i.e., it \nbecomes infected) because of its high in -degree (i.e., the number  of edges pointing to it). In \npanel b) node G i s immunized through targeted removal of its edges: this way, any \noutbreak that starts from the left sub -network (nodes A, B, C, D, E, F) cannot  reach the \nright sub -network (I, H, J), because of its high betweenness. Note that removal of node E \nresult in po or control performances, since its removal is irrelevant with respect to disease \nspread. Similarly, G is an inefficient sentinel, since it has a low degree and it is reached late \nin an epidemic process. Panel c) shows the values of in -degree and betweennes s computed \nfor each node.  \n6.2  Application to crop protection  \nOptimal crop parasites control methods, e.g. allocation of phytosanitary treatments, \nbiological control, resistant varieties or even eradication of suspected hosts, only \noccasionally is explicitly investigated via network properties, as instead it is the case of \ntargeted vaccination or isolation in humans and animals  (Jeger et al.  2007) . In one of \nthese example,  Strona et al. (2017)  found that removing nodes with the highest \nPageRank  (Page  1998)  allows to reduce the size of the largest connected component \n(the largest set of nodes for which a t least one path to any other node in the set exists) \nfaster that using the degree or a random sampling, thus reducing the maximum spread \nof X. fastidiosa . \nBy contrast, some rule s of thumb ( sensu  Chad\u00e8s et al.  2011 ) loosely related to netwo rk-\nthinking have found greater application. For instance, it has been suggested that \nprevention planning may discourage growth of certain crop in marginal areas, which \nafford little profit but may provide chance for disease flow  (Margosian et al.  2009) . In \nthis case, one could visualize main production areas as nodes, connected by edges \nrepresenting marginal areas which allow the s pread of the disease. Under this \nperspective, this disease control strategy translates into an edge -removal problem.  \nShaw and Pautasso (2014)  reported successful experiences following this \nrecommendation in reducing yellow rust of wheat, provoked by P. striiformis , in the \nnorthwest of China  (Lu et al.  2011) . It has been commonly observed that group of crops \ncan remain uninfected if surrounded by immune individuals, as in the case of the soil -\nborne pathogen Rhizoctonia solani  (Bailey et al.  2000) . In this case, cultivated areas can \nplay as nodes, immune areas as immunized nodes, while potential disease pathways as \nedges connecting them. In general, breaking the mono -cultural continuum into \ndisconnected components reduces the opportunity of short -distance pathogen spread  \n(Elton  1958) . Given the definition of betweenness, we argue that this metric may \nsupport the identification of those nodes whose removal would more efficiently break \nthe crop network (Fig. 3b). \nThese rules of thumb could gain more consistency if accompanied by netw ork-based \nprioritization methods, such as a combination of different network metrics.  Xing et al. \n(2020)  evaluated the epidemic network given by a hypothetical pathogen affecting \nmajor crops across the world and  suggested that an index weighting several network \nmetrics (strength, nearest neighbors \u2019 degree, betweenness, eigenvector centrality) may \ngive a comprehensive view of the nodes\u2019 contribution to connectivity. Additionally,  \nAndersen et al. (2019)  suggested that, as well as for surveillance, node characterized by \nhigh (out -)degree may be identified as influential spreaders and so prioritized to be \nimmunized.  \n7 Conclusion  \nAlthough network -thinking is finding wider application in crop protection, its level of \ndiffusion is unbalanced among surveillance and control. Network metrics, such as \ndegree, strength, betweenness, VoteRank, and GRWA are more diffused to support \nsurveillance, while control design in agriculture seems to require a multidisciplinary \napproach.  \nThis imbalance may be due to several factors. A typical problem about the application of \ntheoretical network tools in real cases is the adequately definition of nodes and edges. \nFor example, network algorithms are very often conceived for unweighted, undir ected \nand static networks, while real epidemic networks are frequently asymmetric, weighted \nand/or temporal. Generalizations may miss or distort the original meaning. To meet this \nneed, a growing amount of research has been conducted to broaden the applica tion of \nthese metrics to real matrices  (Fagiolo  2007; Galimberti et al.  2018; Holme  2005; Wang \net al.  2008) , declining them depending on the physical meaning of the edges, but \ngenerally with a loss of straightforwardness.  \nThe challenge of spatial scale is an inveterate obstacle that network -thinking must \naddress in order to expand its applications in agriculture, as pointed out by  Shaw and \nPautasso, (2014) . Edges may be defined to describe extremely long -distance transport \nevents along continents, in the order of 107 \ud835\udc5a (8,000  \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a being distance from South \nAfrica to Australia, perhaps the farthest documented periodical incursion of P. graminis ; \nVisser et al.  2019 ) as well as cellular interaction between the hosts and its pathogens, on  \nthe order of 10\u22125 \ud835\udc5a (26.4 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a being the spore diameter of P. graminis ; Eversmeyer and \nKramer  2000 ), passing through the s cale of a host ( 100 \ud835\udc5a being size of a wheat stem) or \na population ( 103 \ud835\udc5a being the order of the size of an average US farm;  Ritchie and Roser  \n2022 ). Moreover, the geographic scale of a node has crucial consequences for the meaning of applying network -based protection pr actices: to surveil/control a node \nmeans to completely monitor/immunize all the hosts within. Eventually, the choice of a \nnode size is a compromise between the resolution of pathogen dispersal mechanisms \n(setting the biophysical constraints of the network)  and the protection measures \napplicability (setting the management constraints of the network), in addition to ensure \ncomputational viability.  \nBroadening the scope of investigation, social acceptance may be another reason for the \ngap in application of netw ork metrics among surveillance and control strategies. This \ngap may generally reflect a greater social impact of preventive crop control policies in a \nbroad sense, not necessarily related to networks  (Eriksson et al.  2019) . Whereas \noptimal surveillance simply requires to geographically arrange the monitoring activities \nacross a network, control thought node treatment implies an invasive intervention, such \nas the application of phytosanitary products or even the eradication of healthy hosts. \nSocial accept ability of policies aimed at controlling alien pathogens invasions, as X. \nfastidiosa  (Strona et al.  2017) , relies on direct and indirect risk experiences and problem \nawareness of stakeholders, which may lead to a social underestimation of the \nprobability of an invasion versus the concrete loss  of a cultivated unit. Understanding \nthe factors driving social acceptability of crop protection practices may be the key to the \nimplementation of effective control methods  (Marzano et al.  2017) , in particular \nnetwork -based strategies, with a  positive feedback on the theoretical research, and vice \nversa . \nAcknowledgements  \nThis research was supported by  the Beyond project, funded by the French National \nResearch Agency (ANR), the SuMCrop Sustainable Management of Crop Health Program \nand the Tom\u2019Health (2021 -2024) program of INRAE.

{"text": "Synthesizing Missing MRI Sequences from\nAvailable Modalities using Generative\nAdversarial Networks in BraTS Dataset\nIbrahim Ethem Hamamci1,\nDepartment of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\nAbstract. Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and lethal form of brain\ncancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a significant role in\nthe diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of glioblastoma pa-\ntients due to its non-invasive and radiation-free nature. The International\nBrain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge has contributed to gen-\nerating numerous AI algorithms to accurately and efficiently segment\nglioblastoma sub-compartments using four structural (T1, T1Gd, T2,\nT2-FLAIR) MRI scans. However, these four MRI sequences may not\nalways be available. To address this issue, Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs) can be used to synthesize the missing MRI sequences.\nIn this paper, we implement and utilize an open-source GAN approach\nthat takes any three MRI sequences as input to generate the missing\nfourth structural sequence. Our proposed approach is contributed to the\ncommunity-driven generally nuanced deep learning framework (GaN-\nDLF) and demonstrates promising results in synthesizing high-quality\nand realistic MRI sequences, enabling clinicians to improve their diag-\nnostic capabilities and support the application of AI methods to brain\ntumor MRI quantification.\nKeywords: Glioblastoma, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Machine Learn-\ning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Missing Modalities\n1 Introduction\nGlioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and lethal types of brain cancer, and\ndespite advancements in cancer treatment, the prognosis for patients diagnosed\nwith glioblastoma remains poor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a\ncrucial role in the diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of patients with\nglioblastoma. MRI is a widely used medical imaging technology due to its non-\ninvasive and radiation-free nature, and it offers multiple sequences or modalities\nthat provide distinct insights into different patient problems. For instance, T1-\nweighted sequences differentiate between gray and white matter tissues, while\nT2-weighted sequences highlight fluid from cortical tissue. The four structural\nmodalities of brain MRI (T1, T1Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR) are essential for clinicians\nto diagnose different abnormalities.arXiv:2310.07250v1  [q-bio.QM]  11 Oct 20232 et al.\nIn recent years, large-scale datasets such as the International Brain Tumor\nSegmentation (BraTS) dataset [1\u20135] have enabled the development of advanced\nartificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can accurately and efficiently segment\nglioblastomas from the four structural MRI sequences. Manual segmentation\nof brain tumors is a tedious and time-consuming task with low reproducibility\nbetween operators, making the use of AI methods particularly important [6]. AI\nmethods have been shown to save time, reduce human errors, and improve the\naccuracy and speed of the diagnostic process [7\u201312].\nHowever, acquiring all four necessary structural MRI sequences, comprising\nT1-weighted pre- (T1) and post-contrast (T1-Gd) images, native T2-weighted\n(T2), and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) sequences, may\nnot always be practical for each patient due to factors such as cost, data corrup-\ntion, and patient movement or allergies to contrast dye. To address this issue,\ngenerating any one of the missing modalities using AI from the three available\nones is a challenging problem with significant potential benefits. It can facilitate\nmore effective diagnosis by doctors and support the application of AI methods\nto MRI. A promising approach to solving this problem is through the use of vari-\nous synthesis methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which\nhave shown remarkable performance in synthesizing missing modalities [13].\nBy leveraging synthesis methods to replace missing brain MRI sequences,\nclinicians can improve their diagnostic capabilities while also enabling use of\na large existing body of work from BraTS that leverages 4 structural MRI\nsequences to segment brain lesions [14\u201318], and for radiogenomic prediction\n[19\u201321]. This is achieved by synthesizing one of the necessary structural se-\nquences (T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR) that may be missing from a given subject.\nThe literature has explored various approaches and datasets to address the\nissue of missing modalities. For example, one study [13] used a one-input GAN to\nsynthesize a missing modality based on an available one, while another study [22]\nemployed a multi-input GAN that used three other modalities to synthesize the\nmissing one (which is very similar to our approach). Another study uses only\na single score-based network to learn various cross-modal conditional distribu-\ntions in the complete modality space, and can effectively and robustly infer any\nmissing modality based on the learned conditional distribution by leveraging all\nremaining modalities for accurate conditioning [23].\nIn this work, we implement and utilize a GAN approach that takes three\nMRI modalities as inputs to generate the missing modality, incorporating all\navailable information. Our approach yields promising results, demonstrating that\nthe developed models are capable of producing high-quality and realistic images.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Data\nFor our study, we used the BraTS 2021 dataset [1\u20135], which is publicly available\nathttps://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2017/data.html .

First, the T1-Gd model is trained, where the generator\nlearns to produce post-contrast T1-weighted images from the other three modal-\nities, section by section. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between the\ngenerated T1-Gd images and the original ones. At each iteration, the genera-\ntor uses the discriminator\u2019s output to synthesize images that closely resemble\nreal data. Second, the T1 model is trained, with the generator learning to pro-\nduce pre-contrast T1-weighted images from the other three modalities, section\nby section. The third involves training the T2 model, where the generator learns\nto produce T2-weighted images. Fourth, the FLAIR model is trained using the\nsame steps, except that the generator is trained to produce FLAIR images from\nthe other three modalities, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish be-\ntween the generated and original FLAIR images (gFLAIR).\nEach patient had precontrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR images, as\nwell as postcontrast T1-weighted images.\nAll modalities were resampled to 128 \u00d7128\u00d7128 pixels and filtered by elimi-\nnating pixels that have less than 3000 pixel values for preprocessing. All samples\nin the BraTS dataset were included. We removed each modality, including T1-\nweighted, T2-weighted, T1-Gd, and FLAIR, for each training, and the removed\nmodality is used as ground truth.\n2.2 Data partition\nTo quantify our model\u2019s performance, we randomly split the data into training\nand validation sets. The training set consisted of 1,237 subjects, while the vali-\ndation set had 13 subjects. As we resampled each modality to 128 \u00d7128\u00d7128\nvoxels and used 2D layers for training, we had a total of 158,336 images for the\ntraining set and 1,664 images for the validation set for each modality.4 et al.\n2.3 Experimental Design\nThis is a retrospective study using data from the BraTS 2021 challenge [1\u20135].\nWe trained 4 different generators for 4 different missing MRI sequence syntheses\nusing GANs. The goal of the study was to create a model that could generate\nmissing modalities from other available modalities. Our proposed role of the AI\nalgorithm was as an add-on approach to provide additional information about\nmissing modalities. The type of predictive modeling performed was image-to-\nimage translation, and the target of predictions was missing modalities in the\ninput data.\n2.4 Model\nWe adapted Pix2pixHD [24], which is an advanced image-to-image translation\nmodel that takes single input images and generates a single output image.\nPix2pixHD is an advanced deep learning model for image-to-image translation,\nwhich is capable of generating high-resolution and photorealistic images from\nlow-resolution inputs, such as sketches or semantic maps. The model employs\na multi-scale generator architecture to generate images at different scales, and\na multi-scale discriminator to evaluate the generated images at multiple resolu-\ntions. The adversarial losses with feature matching enable the model to capture\nhigh-frequency details and texture information in the generated images. Addi-\ntionally, the model uses a hierarchical semantic segmentation strategy to enhance\nthe quality of the generated images. We adapted the model as it takes 3 inputs\nand outputs 1 to leverage all the available information to generate missing one\nmodality.\n2.5 Training\nWe performed all training procedures and hyperparameters for the Pix2pixHD\nmodel, including augmentation and pre-processing, before the data entered the\ncompute graph. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the model\nperformance. We evaluated model performance as a function of the data parti-\ntions. The training was conducted on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU,\nusing the PyTorch deep learning framework.\n2.6 Data Availability\nThe BraTS dataset is publicly available on the Synapse platform and contains\nmulti-parametric MRI sequences of 1,250 patients with gliomas, each including\nfour modalities: T1, T1-contrast enhanced, T2, and T2-FLAIR.\n2.7 Code Availability\nThe source code and related configurations related to this study are available\nthrough the Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF) [25,26].Synthesizing missing MRI sequences using GANs 5\n3 Results\nWe quantitatively evaluated the performance of our proposed approach on the\nBraTS 2021 dataset, which consists of 1250 patients with glioblastoma. We ran-\ndomly split the dataset into training (?), validation (?), and testing (?) sets.\nThe training and validation sets were used for model training and hyperparam-\neter tuning, while the testing set was used to evaluate the performance of our\nmethod. We used three MRI sequences out of four as inputs to generate the\nmissing modality. We used the same network architecture and hyperparameter\nconfiguration to train models to generate each missing modality.\nTo assess the effectiveness of our approach, we employed four different evalu-\nation metrics. The first metric is the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity\n(LPIPS) metric, which measures the distance between the generated and ground\ntruth images in terms of visual similarity. The Normalized Mutual Information\n(NMI) metric is used to evaluate the overlap between the generated and ground\ntruth images. The Fr\u00b4 echet Inception Distance (FID) metric is a measure of how\nsimilar the distributions of the generated and ground truth images are in terms\nof their feature representations. Finally, we used the Structural Similarity Index\nMeasure (SSIM) to evaluate the structural similarity between the generated and\nground truth images.\nIn addition to these quantitative metrics, we also performed a visual in-\nspection of the generated images to ensure that they were of high quality and\nresembled the ground truth images. This qualitative assessment is important\nbecause it provides additional insights into the performance of the method and\ncan reveal any shortcomings of the quantitative metrics. By combining both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations, we can obtain a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the performance of our method.\nOverall, our proposed method demonstrated promising results for generating\nmissing modalities. The results suggest that our method could be a valuable tool\nfor improving the diagnosis and treatment of patients with glioblastoma.\n4 Discussion\nIn this work, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach to generating\nmissing brin tumor MRI sequences by utilizing a GAN aproach that takes three\nMRI modalities as inputs to generate the missing modality. Our approach showed\npromising results in generating high-quality and realistic images that closely\nresemble ground truth images.\nOne possible explanation for the performance of our method is that it utilizes\nall available information from the three input modalities to synthesize the miss-\ning modality. This approach allows our method to incorporate complementary\ninformation from different modalities, resulting in a more accurate and complete\nrepresentation of the image. In addition, our method can be easily extended to\nincorporate more than three input modalities, allowing us to generate missing\nmodalities even when more than one modality is unavailable.

For in-\nstance, it can be used to generate missing modalities to support the diagnosis of\nbrain tumors, enabling clinicians to make more accurate and informed decisions.\nOur method can also be used to facilitate the application of AI methods to MRI\nby providing complete data for training and testing.\nHowever, there are several limitations and possible future directions that can\nbe pursued based on the findings of this study. Firstly, we have used 2D slices\nfor training, and the use of 3D data and models to generate more realistic and\ndynamic scenes is essential to further improve the performance of the proposed\nmethod. Second, investigating the generalizability of the method on different\ndatasets and pathological conditions is essential to ensure its broader applicabil-\nity. Third, integrating the generated images into downstream analysis, such as\nsegmentation and diagnosis, could be examined. Fourth, exploring the potential\nof the proposed method in clinical settings with real patient data and assessing\nits usefulness for clinical decision-making could be investigated. Fifth, the pro-\nposed method could be applied to generate other types of medical images, such\nas CT or ultrasound, to address missing modalities. Overall, these future direc-\ntions can expand the impact and potential applications of the proposed method\nin the field of medical imaging.\nIn conclusion, our approach demonstrates the potential of utilizing GANs to\ngenerate missing modalities in brain MRI. Our method achieves good perfor-\nmance and has several potential clinical applications. Future work could inves-\ntigate the application of our method to other imaging modalities and evaluate\nits performance on larger datasets.\nReferences\n1. B. H. Menze, A. Jakab, S. Bauer, J.

We present a new framework for this purpose t hat \nmakes very limite d ass umptio ns about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments . \nThe approach st arts from a data set of empirical judgme nts of relative similarities : the fractio n of times \nthat a subject chooses  one of two co mpariso n stimuli to be more s imilar to a reference stimulus. These \nempirical judgments provide Baye sian estimates  of underl ing choice probabilities.  From these estimates, \nwe derive three indices that characterize the set of judgments , measuring consistency with a  symmetr ic \ndis-simila rity, consi stency with an ultrametric  space, and consistency with an additive tree . We illustrate \nthis approach with ex ample ps ychophysical da tasets of dis -similarity  judgments in several visual \ndomains  and provide co de that implements the analyses.  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n3 Introductio n \n \nCharact erization of the similarities between elements of a domain  of sensory or semantic \ninform ation  is important for many reasons.  First, t hese similarities, and the relationships between them, \n(Edelman, 1998;  Kemp & Tene nbaum, 2008; Tversky, 1977) , reveal the cognitive  structure  of the \ndomain. S imilarities are functionally important as they are the substrate for learning, generalization, and \ncategorization  (Kemp & Tenenbaum, 2008;  Saxe, McClelland, & Ganguli, 2019; Shepard, 1958; Zaidi \net al. , 2013) . At a mechanistic level, the quantification of similarities provides a way t o test hypo theses \nconcerning their neural substrates (Kriegeskorte & Kievit, 2013) . Thus, me asuring of perceptual  \nsimilarities , and using these judgme nts to make  inferences about the geometry of t he underl ying \nperceptua l spaces, plays an impo rtant role in  cogni tive and systems neu roscience.   \nThe goal of this work is to present a novel approach that complements t he standard strategies \nused for this purpose . The star ting poin t for the p resent approach, in com mon with standard st rategies, is \na set of triadic simila rity judgments : is stimulus x or stimulus y more  similar  to a reference stimulus \nr? To make geo metric infe rences from such  data, one stan dard approach is to ma ke use of a variant of \nmultidimensional scaling  (de Leeuw & Heiser, 1982; Knoblauch & Maloney, 2008; Maloney & Yang, \n2003; Tsogo, Masson, & Bardot, 2000; J. D. Vic tor, Rizvi, & Conte, 2017; Waraich &  Victor, 2022) , \ni.e., to ass ociate the stimuli with points in a space, so that the distances between the points account for \nthe perc eptual similarities.  Once these points are determined, inferences can be made a bout the \ndimensionality of  the space, its cu rvature , and its to pology. A secon d approach, topological data \nanalysis , makes use of the distances d irectly, and then invokes  graph- theoretic procedures (Dabaghian, \nMemoli, Frank, & Carlsson, 2012; Giusti, Pastalkov a, Curto, & Itskov, 2015; G uidolin, Desroches, \nVictor, Purpura, & Rodrigues, 2022; Singh et al., 2008; Zhou, S mith, & Sharpee, 2018)  to infer these \ngeometri c features.  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n4 In applying these approaches to expe rimenta l data, one  must deal wit h the fact that eve n if a \nforced -choice respon se is req uired, th e response likely represents an unde rlying choice probability \u2013 and \nthat this choice prob ability may depend on s ensory nois e, noise in how distances are mentally computed \nand trans formed into  dis-similarities , and noise in th e decision pro cess in which dis -similarities are \ncompared . As a consequence, a nalysis of an experim ental  dataset requires , at least  implicitly, substantial \nassumptions . Such assumptio ns are not always b enign:  a monot onic transformation  of dis tances \u2013  which \npreserves bina ry sim ilarity ju dgments \u2013 can alter the dimensionality and curvature of a mult idimensiona l \nscaling model  (Kruskal & Wish, 1978) . Top ological data analysis via persisten t homologies , which only \nmakes use of rank order s of di stances , is invariant to a global monotonic transformation  of dis tances, but  \nmakes ot her assumptions  (for example, that  this trans format ion is the same  across the domain ), and does \nnot typically take into acc ount a noise model.  \nWith these considerations in mind , here we pursue an app roach to ma ke inferences f rom the \nchoice probabilit ies th emselves,  as esti mated from repeat ed triadic judgments . Our main assu mption is \nthat if, for any pa rticular triad, stim ulus x is cho sen more often than stimu lus y as closer to a ref erence \nr, then the di fference be tween x and r is less than the distance between y and r. Note that we do not \nmake any assumption s about how r elative or absolu te distan ces are tra nsformed into choice probabilities  \nwithin an indi vidual triad, or whethe r this transformation is the same across the d omain.   \nWhile the limited natur e of these assumptions necessary limits  the inferences that  can be made, \nthe ap proach ne verthele ss can characteri ze a set of  similarity judgme nts in th ree impor tant wa ys. First, \nwe ask whether the  similarity judgme nts satisf y a relationship that is require d for a symmetric notion  of \ndista nce. Then, assuming that d istances are sym metric, we deri ve an index of whethe r the judgments are \nconsisten t with an  ultrametric space (Semmes, 2007) , i.e., a set of distances that derives from a \nhierarc hical representation . Finally, we index the extent to which the judgments are c onsis tent with a n Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n5 additive tre e, (Sattath & Tversky, 1977) , a generalization  of an ultrametric space. E ach o f these  indic es \nare grad ed, and can be viewed as quantifying the global cha racteristics  of a set of similarity judg ments, \nwithout the n eed to model how choice probabi lities , distances, noise, and decision  processes are related.   \nWe illustrate the appr oach with several sam ple psychophysical datase ts, and provide code to \ncarry out these computations . Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n6  \nTheory  \n \nOverview a nd Preliminaries  \nOur goal i s to develop indices that c haracterize a dataset of triadic si milarity jud gments , in a way \nthat provid es insight into the structure  of the underlyi ng perceptual space . Our c entral assu mption is that , \nwithin a triadic judgment, the probability that a participant  choo ses one pair of stimuli as more simil ar \nthan an alternative is monotonically related to the s imilarity . Typical datasets include large numbers of \nsimilarity j udgment s of overlapping triads , and the relat ionship between these judgme nts contains \ninformation about the underlying perceptual spac e. We show how this information  can be accessed, \nwithout further making assumptions about the specifics of the  monotonic relatio nship between choice \nprobability and (dis)-similarity , whether it is constant throughout the space, or the decision process \nitself.  \nWe focus on paradigms in which the bas ic unit of dat a coll ection and analysis is a triad  (; , )rxy , \nconsisting of a stimulus  r , designated as the reference, and two  other s timuli , x and y designate d as \nthe compa rison stimul i. The participant  is asked to decide, in a f orced-choice re sponse, which of the two \ncomparis on stim uli is more  similar  to the ref erence. We consider t his to be a  probabilistic  judgment, and \ndenote th e underlying probability that a participant judges x as more similar to r than y is to r as \n(; , )Rrxy .  \nThe underlying probab ility (; , )Rrxy  is unknown, and mus t be estimated from the trials in wh ich \nthe triad (; , )rxy  is presented.  We d enote the number of such t rials by (; , )Nrxy  and use (; , )Crxy  to \ndenote t he number of trials in which the participant judge s x as mor e similar to r than y is to r.

We denote the  dis-similarit y of a comparison stim ulus z to a re ference stimulus r by \n(, )Drz .

Spec ifical ly, we only make  use o f the sign of the \ncompa rison \u2013 for exam ple, that an alligator and toothpast e are more  dis-similar  than an a lligator and  a \npanda.   We do not attempt t o infer th e size of thi s difference, in absolute terms , relative to an internal \nnoise, or relative to  the dis -similarity of another pair of stimuli that wa s not ex plicitly compared  within a \ntriad. \nThe present analysis, which appl ies most directl y to a para digm in wh ich each t rial is devoted to \njudgment of a sing le triad, is appl icable to othe r paradigms  in which individual trials yield judgments \nabout more than one triad, provided that each judgment can be considered to be in dependent of the \ncontext in whic h it is ma de. For example, in the \u201codd one out\u201d para digm (also known as the \u201coddity \ntask\u201d (Kingdom & Prins, 2016)), th ree stimu li are presented and the participant is asked to choose which \none is t he outli er. Here , a se lection of  a stimu lus jx out of a triplet {, ,}jklxxx  can be interpreted a s a \njudgme nt that (,) (,)k j klDx x Dx x\uf03e  and also that (, ) (, )l j lkDx x Dx x\uf03e , and thus contributes to estima tes \nof choice probabilities fo r two triad s, (;,)k jlxxx  and (; , )l jkxxx . The analy sis is also applicable to \nparadigms in which the participant is asked to rank m comparison stimuli  1,...,m xx  in order of  similarity \nto a re ference stimulus r (Waraich  & Victor, 2022). The  ranking obta ined on each tr ial then contributes \nto esti mation of choice probabili ties fo r 2m\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0f8 triads (; , )klrx x , one for e ach pair of compari son st imuli.   \nWe do not r equire that  the experiment ex plore all triad s (in an expe riment with  M stimu li, there \nare 1 1( 1)( 2)2 2MM MM M\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf02d\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0f7\uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0f8 distin ct triads), but the incisiveness of the approach wil l naturally Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n9 impro ve as more triads are expl ored an d as each triad  is presented more often , so tha t (; , )obsR rxy  is a \nbetter estimator of (; , )Rrxy . \nAssessing  symm etry \nThe first i ndex we develop tests the extent to  which the dis -similarities underlying the  perceptual \njudgments are consistent w ith a symmetr ic distance, i.e., a distance in which the reference and \ncomparison stimuli are  treated a like. To do this, we fi rst ide ntify necessary condit ions on the dis-\nsimilariti es (, )Dxy  requi red by this symmetry . This yields a set of  inequalities that the unde rlying \nchoice probabilities  (; , )Rrxy  must s atisfy. The n, we take a Bayesian approach: given the observed data \n(; , )obsR rxy , whi ch are only estim ates of the cho ice probabilit ies (; , )Rrxy , we determine the likelihood \nthat th ese choi ce probabilities (; , )Rrxy  are consistent w ith the r equisite inequalities.   \n(2.3) A necessary co ndition  for symmet ry \nTo derive conditions on the choice probabil ities that ar e necessary  for symmetric d is-similarities , \nwe first note that if the dis -similarity is sy mmetric,  then at least  one of the three inequa lities  \n (, ) (,)\n(, ) (, )\n(,) (,)Dxy Dxz\nDzx Dzy\nDyz Dyx\uf0fc \uf03c \uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf03c \uf0fd\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf03c \uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0fe  (2.1)  \nmust be f alse. For if a ll of the i nequalities (2.1) held, and the dis- simila rity is symme tric, alternate \napplic ation of one of (2.1) and the assumption of symmetry  would lead to a contr adiction \n ( , )( , )( , )( , )( , )( , )Dxy Dxz Dzx Dzy Dyz Dyx\uf03c\uf03d\uf03c\uf03d\uf03c , (2.2) \nas a quantity cannot be les s than itself . \nTo translate  the condition that at least one of (2.1) m ust be false i nto a condition on the choi ce \nprobabilities , we use the central hypothesis, that dis-similarities and choice probabili ties are Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n10 monotonically rel ated wi thin a triad (e q.

A slightly stronger statement is that at least one of (2.3) and at least  one of (2.4) \nmust be fals e, even when two of the three inequa lities in either set are repla ced b y an in clusi ve \ninequality . (These borde rline cases, while not  crucial her e, will be important for testing the ul trametric \nproperty bel ow.) \nThese conditions can be summarized as fol lows: if at least one of th e triple t of choice \nprobabi lities (; ,)Rxyz , (; , )Rzxy , and (;,)Ryzx  is strictly greate r than 1/2, then at le ast one of t hem \nmust also be strictly les s than 1/2, and vice- versa.  Put ano ther way: the triplet of choice probabilities  \n(; ,)Rxyz , (; , )Rzxy , and (;,)Ryzx  can only reflec t a symmetric  dis-similarity  if the triplet of v alues \nlies in a speci fic subset symS of 3[0,1] . Othe r than boundary points, symS consi sts of the cube 3[0,1]  from \nwhich two smaller cubes, 31[ ,1]2 (eq. (2.3)) and 31[0, ]2 (eq. (2.4)), are removed.  \nLikelihood ra tio calc ulation and an index  \nWe now us e the observ ed data to det ermine the likelihood that , given observed respon ses for a \ntriplet of triads  (; ,)xyz , (; , )zxy , and (;,)yzx , the co rresponding triplet of choice probabilities lies in  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n11 symS, vs. i ts complement 3[0,1] \\symS. We use a Bay esian approach: the a pos teriori  likelihoo d of a  \ntriplet of choice probabilit ies (; ,)Rxyz , (; , )Rzxy , and (;,)Ryzx  is proport ional to the product  of thei r \nprior prob abilities, and the probability t hat they will lead to th e observed responses.  We th en integra te \nthis product ove r the space of choice pro babili ties in which, for each triple t, at l east one of (2.3) and at \nleast one of (2.4) is false . This s pace is a product of the domains symS for each tripl et, which we denote \nby sym\uf057. We co mpare this in tegral with an integral of the a pos teriori likelihood ove r all possible ch oice \nprobabi lities, which  we denot e \uf057, to assess how much of th is total  likelihood is co nsistent with \nsymmetry . To carry out these i ntegrations, w e exp loit the fact  that the  cons traints  that define sym\uf057 are \ngrouped into triplets, and  the choice probabilities in each tr iplet are d isjoint. Because of  this disjointness, \nthe integra l over sym\uf057 factors into a product of i ntegr als over multiple copies of the domain symS, with \none copy for each triplet . \nTo begin the Bayes ian app roach, we choose a product of Di richlet distributions (Ferguson, 1973) \nof identic al shape as the prio r for the set of choice probabiliti es. This choice is both analytically \nconvenient and prac tical for real data  (see Results), but it is not es sential to the appr oach . As each \nprobabil ity is univariate, the Dirichlet pri or reduces to a b eta func tion, so our prior is that each choice \nprobability is independently distri buted  according to  \n 11\n,1( ) (1 )(,)ab\nabpR R RBab\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf040 .

Since symmetric dis-\nsimilarit ies guarantee cons istency with a metric -space structure, it is therefore nat ural to as k whe ther th e \ndis-similarities have furt her propert ies consistent with specific kinds of me tric spaces. \nUltrametric spac es (Semmes, 2007) are on e importan t such kind, as they abstr act the notion of a \nhierarchical or ganiza tion. Points in an ultram etric space cor respond to th e terminal nodes of a tree, and \nthe distance between tw o points c orrespo nds t o the height o f their first co mmon ance stor. Formally, a  \ndistance d is said to sat isfy the ult rametric ineq uality  if, for a ny three po ints x, y, and z,  \n \uf028 \uf029 (, ) m a x (,) , (,)dxy dxz dyz\uf0a3 , (3.1) \na condition that i mplies the t riangle inequality (Appendix 1). E ssentia lly, (3.1) sta tes that any trian gle is  \nisosceles, with the two equa l sides no shor ter than the t hird.  \nNecessary and sufficient cond itions  \nTo determine the e xtent to which a set of responses is consistent with  the ul trametric in equality, \nwe fi rst restat e (3.1) in terms of dis-similarit ies and dis tances: \n \uf028 \uf029 (, ) m a x (,) , (,)Dxy Dxz Dyz\uf0a3 . (3.2) \nSince ( Appendix 1, eq. (6.6) ) dis-similarities can  always be t ransformed in to distance s via a mono tonic \ntransfo rmation, consis tency of th e dis-similarity  structure with (3.2) i s equ ivalent to cons istency with  \ndistances t hat satisfy the ultrametric  property (3.1). \nWe now recast (3.2) in te rms of c hoice probabiliti es. Si nce the conditions need  to apply to the \nthree point s x, y, and z taken in any orde r, (3.2) means  that among (, )Dxy , (,)Dyz  and (, )Dzx , \ntwo m ust be eq ual and no le ss than the th ird.

(3.3) \nWe denote the region of 123(, , )RRR -space defined by (3.3) as umiS. Just as we had m easured \nconsistency  with sy mmetry by determining the fraction of the posterior distribution of choice \nprobabilities th at lies in symS, here we seek to measure consistency with the ultrametric condition by \ndetermining to what extent the posterior distribution of ch oice pro babil ities lies in umiS. \nLikeliho od ratio calculation and an in dex \nA direct applic ation of the m achinery  developed in the p revious s ection  runs i nto an immediate \ndiffic ulty: the conditions (3.3) are only satisfi ed on a  set of me asure zer o, whe n at lea st one of th e iR are \nexactl y equal to 1\n2. So a B ayesi an analysi s that begi ns with a Dirichlet prior  will al ways  lead to a \nlikelih ood ratio of zero , independent of the data : because the Dirichlet prior is continuous, any poste rior \nderive d from via Ba yes ru le will never have a dis crete mass at 1\n2, as w ould be req uired to satisfy (3.3).  \nIt is nevertheless p ossible to capture the spirit of u ltrametric beh avior in a rigorous wa y, and at \nthe same time, address a way i n which the Dirich let pri or may be unrea listic. To do this, we recognize \nthat for some triads, it may be appropriate to model the  underlying choice  probability as exactly 1\n2, \ncorresponding to stimuli for which there is no basis for  comparison: is a toot hbrush or a mountain  more \nsimilar to a n orange? B ut we d on\u2019t know, a priori , how many of the triads have this  property. To ta ke \nthis into account, we generali ze the prior for each choice pro babil ity to be  a sum of two co mponents : Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n20 one component is the Diri chlet pri or used above (2.7), norma lized to 1h\uf02d; the second component i s a \npoint mass a t 1\n2, normaliz ed to h:  \n 11\n,11 1( ) (1 ) ( ) ( ) (1 ) ( )2 (,) 2aa\nah ahp R h pR hR R R hRBaa\uf064\uf064\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf02b\uf02d \uf03d \uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf040 . (3.4) \nWith this prior, w e can then determin e the likelihood ra tio as a function of h. For s mall values of \nh, the likelihood ratio will b e proportion al to h, sinc e the mass in the prior at 1\n2 is proportiona l to h. \nThe proportionality as 0 h\uf0ae thus serves as an index of co nsistency with the ult rametric p roperty. An \nalternativ e approach (no t taken here) is that i f the experimen tal dataset suggest th at a prior ,()ahpR  with  \n0h\uf03e is a subst antially better fit to th e distribution  of ch oice probabilities  than ,0()apR , this pr ior can be \nused dire ctly to calc ulate  a likelihood r atio, and the best- fitting value of h then provides an ad ditional \ndescriptor of the dataset .  \nTo implement this strateg y, we write the likelihood ratio as  \n (, ;)(, ;)\n(, ;)umi\numi\nsymU CNhL R CNh\nU CNh\uf03d\uf072\uf072\uf072\uf072\n\uf072\uf072 . (3.5) \nwhere the numerator is a likelihood equal to the integra l ove r choice probabiliti es consistent with the \nultrametric ineq uality (and a symmetric dis -similarity ), and the den ominator is a likelihood equal to the \nintegral ov er choic e probabilitie s consi stent with a sym metric dis-similarity but wi thout the u ltrametric \nconstraint. As above, bec ause the triads  form independent triplets , both numerator and denominator ca n \nbe factored i nto a product of terms  ( , ;)umi T TU CNh\uf072\uf072\n or ( , ;)sym T TU CNh\uf072\uf072\n, one for each triplet T\u2208trip. \nThese terms are of the form  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n21  1 11\n1 11\n[ 0,1]\n,1 , 111( , ; ) sgn( ), ,sgn( ) (1 ) (1 )22\n() ( )k kk\nkC NC C NC\nTT k k k\nah ah k kU CNh V R R R R R R\np R p R dR dR\uf02d \uf02d \uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0f7 \uf0e7\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d \uf02d \uf0b7\uf0b7 \uf02d \uf0b7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0f8\n\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0f2\uf072\uf072\n\uf04c\uf04c\n\uf04c\uf04c, (3.6) \nwhere 1(, , )k V\uf073\uf073\uf04c , which is 0 or 1, def ines the space of cho ice pr obabi lities that co ntributes to the \nintegral for the triads in  T.

Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n25 Assessi ng additive tree s tructure  \nLike the ultrametric model,  the additive si milarity  tree model (Sattath & Tversky, 1977) is metric \nspace mode l that pla ces constr aints on th e properti es of the distance, but these constrai nts are less -\nrestrictive than the constraint s of the ultrametric model (Appendix 2). In this m odel, here  referred to as \n\u201caddtree,\u201d t he di stance between two points is de termin ed by a graph that has a tree stru cture , in which  \neach link has a specified nonz ero wei ght. The dista nce between two points is given by the tot al weig ht \nof the path that connec ts the poi nts. Because of the requirement that the graph is a tree structure,  there \nare no loops \u2013 and this places constraints on the inter -relatio nships of the dista nces.  \nHere, we deter mine the extent to which th e dis-similaritie s implied by a set of triadic  judgments \ncan be monotonically t ransform ed into the distan ces in an addtree model.  \nThe starting poi nt is a necessary and sufficient condition for distances in a metric space to be \nconsistent with a n addtree structure  (Bun eman , 1974; Dobson, 1974; Sattath & Tversky, 1977). This \ncondition, know n as the \u201cfour-point condition,\u201d is that give n any four points u, v, w, and x, \n(,) ( ,)\n(, ) (, ) .\n(, ) (, )duv dwx\nNone of the three quantities d u w d v x is strictly greater than the other two\ndux dvw\uf0ec\uf0fc\uf02b\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf02b\uf0ed\uf0fd\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf02b\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ee\uf0fe  (4.1)  \nPut another w ay, of the three pair wise sums in  eq. (4.1) , two must b e equal, an d larger than the third. \nAppendix 2 shows that this condition is weaker than th e ultrame tric in equality and s tronger than the  \ntriang le ine quali ty, and that a one-dim ensional arran gement of points is always consistent  with an \naddtree m odel.   \nSince the four-point condition is based  on adding distances, we cannot apply it directly to dis-\nsimilarities \u2013 as distance s are linked to dis-similarity v ia an un known monotonic function. Ins tead, we \nframe  a con dition on the dis- similarities that i s necessary for the  four- point inequality to hold. Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n26 Necessary conditions \nSince the fou r-poi nt condition  asserts that, among the thr ee ways of pairing fo ur points , none c an \nresult in a total distance that is  strictly grea ter than the other two, i t is forced to f ail if the thre e pairwise -\nsummed distances ar e distinct.  If this is  the case, we can rela bel the points so that  \n (,) ( ,) (, ) (,) (,) (, )duv dwx duw dvx dux dvw\uf02b\uf03e \uf02b\uf03e\uf02b . (4.2) \nIf (4.2) holds, (4.1) cannot. So failures of at least o ne of the inequalities in (4.2) is necessary for  the \naddtree model , and consequently, inequalit ies amo ng dis -similarities that guarantee the inequalities \namong the distances in (4.2) rule out the addtree mode l. \nFor e xample, the inequ alities in  (4.2) are forced to hold if th e three fi rst ter ms and t he three \nsecond term s in e ach of th e its su ms are in desce nding or der:  \n ( , )( , )( , ) ( , )( , )( , )duv duw dux a n d dwx dvx dvw\uf03e\uf03e \uf03e\uf03e . (4.3) \nSince the dis tances are mon otonic ally relate d to th e dis-similari ties, (4.3) is equivale nt to \n ( , )( , )( , ) ( , )( , )( , )Duv Duw Dux a n d Dwx Dvx Dvw\uf03e\uf03e \uf03e\uf03e . (4.4) \nThus, (4.4) , which does not rely on adding dis-s imilarities or distances,  suffices  to rule out th e addtree \nmodel.  \nIt is useful to think of t he two parts o f (4.4) geo metrically , with the four p oints {,, ,}uvwx  \narranged in a tetrahedr on (Figure 1 ). The f irst part of (4.4) comp ares dis-similar ities that pair one ver tex \nu with the o ther thre e vertices; we c all this set of dis -similarities a \u201c tripod\u201d. The s econd part of  (4.4) \ncompar es the dis- similarities of t he edges of the tria ngle on the  face oppos ite to u; we call these dis -\nsimilarit ies the \u201cbase\u201d.  The combination of a trip od and a base is a \u201c tent\u201d \u2013a quadruple of points in \nwhich one of them is distingui shed. \nAssuming all dis -similarities  are distinct, we c an relabel  the poi nts v, w, and x so that the dis-\nsimilarities involving u are in  descending order. Thus, (4.4) can be r estated simply : the rank order of Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n27 dis-similaritie s of the tripod, and the rank order o f dis-similarit ies of the opposi te edges in th e bas e, \ncannot be identical.  \nThis vi ewpoint reveals other ways tha t rank -orders of dis- similarit ies can force  (4.2) : whenever \nthe longes t side of a tripod and the longest side of a base are opposite each other. When this hap pens, the \nleftmost pair  of (4.2) is necessar ily larger than e ach of the o ther two pairs, an d the four -point c ondition \n(4.1) c annot hold. That is, for a tent with vert ex z and base {,,}abc , the following conjunction rules out \nthe addtree m odel: \n(,) (,) (,) (, ) (,) (, ) (,) (,)D z c D z b and D z c D z a and D a b D c a and D a b D b c\uf03e\uf03e \uf03e \uf03e . (4.5) \nThe addtre e model is als o ruled out if som e of the  inequali ties in (4.5) are non- strict: (,) (, )Dzc Dza>  \ncan be replaced by (,) (, )Dzc Dza\u2265  prov ided that (,) (,)Dab Dbc\uf03e  remains strict (and vice- versa), an d \nsimilarly for (,) (,)Dzc Dzb>  and (, ) (, )Dab Dca\uf03e . Note that this conjunction only invol ves choice \nprobabiliti es within the tripod, or w ithin t he base.   \nWe show in Appendi x 3 that if the conjunction (4.5) is false for the dis -similarit ies among four \npoints and all of  their relabeling s, then there i s a monotonic transformation  () d FD=  of the d is-\nsimilarities into distances, for which the distances satisfy the four-point condition. That is, falsity of the \nconjunction (4.5) is necess ary fo r an addtre e mo del and suff icient for an addtr ee model among t he four \npoints. This stops short of showing that falsification of the conjunction (4.5) fo r all quadruplets is \nsufficie nt for a global addtree  model, as the ar gument in Appendix 3 only identif ies a monotonic \ntransformation of the dis -similaritie s among individual four-point subsets. Appendix 3 doe s not sh ow \nthat the monotonic t ransformatio ns ne eded for each quadruple of points can be made in a globally-\nconsisten t way , though we do not have examples to  the cont rary.   \nLikelihood ra tio calcu lation and an inde x \n Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n28 We now formulat e an i ndex that  meas ures the extent to wh ich the ch oice prob abilities underlying \na set of obs ervations corres ponds to dis- similarities that falsify the conjun ction (4.5). Th is index \ntherefore reflects the likelihood t hat the choice probabilities fulfill a con dition t hat is necessary for an \naddtr ee model.  \nAt first, we consider an i ndex closel y analogous to (2.24) : a log-likeliho od ratio, averaged over \ntents, comparing the mass of choice probabilities that is within the region in which the conjunction (4.5) \nis falsified, to the mass t hat is merely consistent with a symmet ric dis -similarity  of the choice \nprobabilities that make  up the t ent: \n (, ;) 1( , ; ) log#( ) (, ;)addtree\naddtree\nsymtentU CNhI CNh\nU CNh\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf03d \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf072\uf072\uf072\uf072\n\uf072\uf072tent, (5.1) \nwhere tent is the set of te nts. \nThis formul ation , however, is pro blemat ic: in contrast t o the indices for symme try and \nultrametric structure , which  were averages over t riplets, this is an average over tents.  Distinct t riplets \nhave non- overlappi ng triads, but for distinct tents , triads may overlap . For  example, a tent with ver tex z \nand base {,,}abc  has a triad (; , )zab , and this triad is shared wi th the tent with verte x z and base \n\uf07b \uf07d,,abq , and with the tent with verte x y and base \uf07b \uf07d,,zab . Thus, the previous factoriz ation of the \nlikelihood inte grals into low-dimensional pieces does not apply to th e num erator of (5.1).  \nWe there fore replace (5.1) by a heuristic approxim ation, in whi ch we ignore t his overlap: \n ( , ;) 1( , ; ) log#( ) ( , ;)addtree T T\naddtree\nTsymtent T TU CNhI CNh\nU CNh \uf0ce\uf0e6\uf0f6\uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0a2 \uf03d \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0f8\uf0e5\uf072\uf072\uf072\uf072\n\uf072\uf072\ntent tent. (5.2) \naddtreeI\uf0a2 is no longer a lo g like lihood ratio, but  will s till exp ress the  extent to whic h the data are consi stent \nwith a necessar y condition for the addtr ee model .

For \ndefiniteness,  given a t ent with z at th e vertex  and {,,}abc  at the base, we specify the six choi ce \nprobabilit ies needed to comput e V as follows: for the tripod com ponent, 1 (;,) R Rzbc\uf040 , \n2 (;, ) R Rzca\uf040 , 3 (; , ) R Rzab\uf040 ; for the  base,  4 (;,) R Rabc\uf040 , 5 (;, ) R Rbca\uf040 , 6 (; , ) R Rcab\uf040 . All of \nthese (and  no other s) enter into th e condition that (4.5) is falsified for this tent: the choice probabil ities \n1R, 2R, 4R, and 5R are explicit in (4.5), all of the iR are use d equal ly as the base elements {,,}abc  are \npermute d. Since V has six  arguments, each of wh ich can take on any of three values { 1, 0 , 1}\u2212 , there are  \n63 729=  values to specify .  \nFor addtreeV , it is simplest  to specify these va lues algorithm ically. For a  set of choice pr obabilities \nto be cons istent with the a ddtree model (i.e., for 1addtreeV=), the conjunction (4.5) cann ot hold for any of \nthe permutations of {,,}abc . Since (4.5) is symmetric  under inte rchange of a and b, it su ffices to \nconside r the cyclic permutations. So the region of 6[0,1]  in which 1addtreeV= is the intersection  of the \nregion tha t falsifies the conjunct ion (4.5), which we denote []c\naddtreeV , and the regions that falsify it after \ncyclic p ermutation of (,,)abc , which we denote []a\naddtreeV  and []b\naddtreeV .

They provided \ninformed consent f ollowing institutional guidelines and the D eclarati on of Helsinki, according to a \nprotocol t hat was approved by the rele vant institution . \nIn addition to the calc ulations described above, we also c alculated  the indices symI, umiI, and \naddtreeI\u2032  for surr ogate datasets.  Surrogate datasets were constructed two ways . The \u201c flip al l\u201d surrogat e was \ncreat ed by randomly selecting tr iplets  and flipping all choice probabi lities  (replacing (; , )obsR rxy  by \n1 (; , )obsR rxy\uf02d ) for the three t riads within the selected t riplets. Th e \u201cflip any\u201d surrogate w as created by \nrandomly selecting ind ividual triads, and flipping the choi ce probabilities  for th e selected triads. Si nce \nthe indices are sums of values that ar e independently computed eit her from triplets or tents, the e xact \nmeans and standard deviations of th e surroga te indices c ould be c omputed efficiently by exhaustive \nsamp ling of each triplet or te nt separately, rath er than approximated via a random sam pling. Note also  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n35 that the \u201cflip all\u201d surrogate leaves symI unchanged, since the two criter ia for symmetric dis- similarities \n(eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) ) sim ply swap when all ch oice probabilities  are flipped.  The maxi mum-l ikelih ood \nparameters a and h (eq. (3.4) ) for the surroga tes are also identical to those for the origin al datasets, \nsince the  prior is unchanged by flipping the choice probabilities.  \nFinally, we estim ated the standar d errors for the indices calculated  from t he original datasets via \na jackknife on triplets (for symI, umiI) or tents (fo r addtreeI\u2032 ). Maximum- likelih ood parameters a and h \nwere not re- calculated for the jack knife subsets, as pilot ana lyses conf irmed that removal of one triplet \nor tent made very little ch ange in the maximum- likelihood value.  \nResults  \nTextures  \nThe \u201ct extures\u201d exper iment made u se of the stimu lus space describ ed in (Victor & Co nte, 2012), a \n10-dimen sional space of binary t extures  with well -char acterized di scrimination thre sholds ( Victor, \nThengone, Rizvi, & Conte, 2015) . We chose a tw o-para meter  component of this dom ain (Figure 2A ) \nthat allowed a focus on testing for c ompatibil ity for addtree structure. The two parame ters chosen, \u03b2\u2212 \nand |\u03b2, determine  the nearest-neighbor c orrelations in the horiz ontal or vertical directio n: the probability \nthat a pair of a djacent checks have the  same lumi nance (either both black or bot h white) is  (1 ) / 2\u03b2+ , \nand the probability that a pair of adjacent checks hav e the opposi te lum inance (one blac k, the othe r \nwhite) is (1 ) / 2\u03b2\u2212 . Oth er than these constrai nts, the te xtures ar e maximum- entropy (see ( Victor & \nConte, 2012) f or details). For the se experimen ts, we chose values of \u03b2\u2212 or |\u03b2 from - 0.9 to 0.9 in steps of \n0.15. That is, six stim uli had posit ive values  of \u03b2\u2212 (0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.75, 0.90) with |0\u03b2=, six \nhad the corresponding ne gativ e values of \u03b2\u2212, six had positive va lues of |\u03b2 with 0\u03b2\u2212=, six had negative Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n36 values of |\u03b2 with 0\u03b2\u2212=, and one had _| 0\u03b2\u03b2= = . In th e experi ment, each stim ulus exampl e was \nunique\u2013 tha t is, a stimulus  is specified by a par ticular _|( ,)\u03b2\u03b2  pair, but the texture example used on each \ntrial was a different rando m sample fro m that texture .  \nThe rationale fo r this stimu lus set is t hat we anticipa ted that certain subsets of stimuli would be \nmore compatible  with the addtree model th an others. The basi s for these expec tations is shown in Figure \n2B, which presents non- metric  multidimensional scaling of the similarity  data. This analys is, carried o ut \nwith the proce dure detailed in (Waraich  & Victor, 2022), uses a max imum-l ikelihood criterion to pla ce \nthe 25 stimulus points in a space , so tha t the Euclidean distances  between th em best  accou nt for the \nchoice proba bilities  (assuming  a uniform,  additive  decision noise). Consiste ntly across par ticipant s, the \npoints along each st imulus axi s ( \u03b2\u2212 or |\u03b2) map  to a gra dually curvi ng traje ctory. For th is reason, we \nanticipate th at comparison data from the stimuli on one of these trajectories  (the 1 3 points with eith er \u03b2\u2212 \nor |\u03b2 equal t o zero, here called an \u2018\u201d axis\u201d) when a nalyzed i n iso lation , will be clo se to an addtree mo del. \nHowever , the two t rajectories  are not perpendicul ar: rays wi th same sign s of \u03b2 meet at  an acute angle  of \n45\u00b0 or le ss. That is, stim uli w ith strong positive correlations (_0\u03b2> compa red to |0\u03b2>) are seen  as \nrelatively similar to each other. Th is is antici pated  to make the subset consisting of the 13 points w ith \neither \u03b2\u2212 or |\u03b2 positi ve (a \u201cvee\u201d) inconsi stent with the addtree mode l, as the shortest perceptu al path \nbetween two points at the end of the positiv e \u03b2\u2212 or |\u03b2 rays is  much shorter than a p ath that trav erses \neach ray back to the o rigin. Similar reas oning ind icates that the vee formed by the two negativ e rays  \nshould also be inconsistent with an addtree m odel. Not e, though, that this intuition assumes that t he \nEuclidean dist ances in Figure 2B are an accurat e account of the percept ual dis-s imilarities; the analysis \nvia addtreeI\u2032  does not make this assumption. Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n37 Figure 3 shows the in dices symI, umiI, and addtreeI\u2032  computed from the f ull datasets for e ach \nparticipant , and for the axis  and ve e subsets.  As expected from th e above anal ysis, t he addtree i ndex \naddtreeI\u2032  is sub stantially higher for the \u201c axis\u201d subset s than  for the \u201cvee\u201d subset s, and has an intermed iate \nvalue fo r the full dataset. Note that \u201caxis\u201d and \u201cvee\u201d subsets are in terms of the number of  stimuli , and \nwere c ollected simultaneously  within a  singl e exper iment . This  finding supports t he efficacy of addtreeI\u2032  in \nproviding a c haracteriza tion of t he dataset regarding consistency with th e addtree mod el. In all cases, it \nis higher than the a priori  value, and subst antially higher tha n val ues computed from surr ogate data sets \nin which choice probabilities are r ando mly flipp ed.  This latter point indica tes (not su rprisingly ) that for \nall of th ese subsets,  there are portions of the data that are mo re con sisten t with an addtree m odel than  \nchance.   \nFor this datas et, values of symI were  quite close to zero (usua lly 0.1>\u2212 ), indicating that nea rly \nall (0.1e\u2212> ) of the posterior distribution  of ch oice p robabilities  was consistent with a symm etric dis -\nsimilarity . umiI, which measure s consistency w ith the ultram etric model, wa s typically -0.25 or less, \nsubstantially below the a priori  value of zero. But interestingly , the highest v alues of umiI were seen in \nthe \u201cvee\u201d subset s, suggesting a part ially hierarchical  structure  \u2013e.g., that the two direc tions of correlation \nformed categori es. As was t he case for  addtreeI\u2032 , all indic es were highe r than for surrogates  constructed by \nrandom ly flipping the c hoice probabilities . For symI, this is uns urprising , as random ly flip ping choice \nprobabilities would  be unlikely to l ead to a set of symmetric  judgments. For umiI, this finding indicate s \nthat, ev en though the ult rametric model is  excluded, the dat a has isla nds of co nsistency  with the \nultrametric stru cture. \nThe above r esults were i nsensitive to  the par amet ers a and h of the prior for th e distribution of \nchoice pro babilities  (eqs. (2.7) and (3.4)). The Diri chlet  paramet er a obtaine d by maximum l ikelih ood Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n38 (eq. (2.10) ) ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 ( with the  lowest values for the fu ll texture dataset) , but very similar \nresults as Fi gure 3 we re obtain ed with settin g 0.5a=  for a ll datasets.  For umiI, the limit in (3.15) was \nestimated by setting 0.001h=  but si milar v alues were ob tained for 0.01h= . The findings f or symI and \naddtreeI\u2032 , here sh own for 0h=, were  not s ubstantially ch ange d when h was determ ined by maximum \nlikelihood. These values of h were typically q uite small ( median, 57 10\u2212\u00d7 ). \nFaces \nThe \u201c faces\u201d experiment used s timuli drawn  from the public- domain library of faces, at \nhttps:/ /faces.mpdl.mpg.de/im eji/, which contained color photographs of 171 individuals, stratified in \nthree age ranges ( \u201cyoung\u201d, \u201c middle \u201d, \u201cold\u201d ). We  randomly se lected two males and t wo females from \neach age r ange , and for each individua l in the faces database, used the two example photo graphs with \nneutral expressions , for a total of 24 unique images (2 genders \u00d7  3 age r ange s \u00d7 2 individuals \u00d7  2 \nphotographs of each) .  \nThe rationale for t his choice of stimuli w as that the above hiera rchical  organizatio n might lead to \na similarity struc ture close to ult rametric behavior. As shown in Fi gure 4, upper row, while this was not \nthe cas e for analysis of the full dat aset ( 0umiI<,the a priori  level) , it w as the case for the 8- stimulu s \nsubsets withi n each  age b racket ( 0umiI>). Values of  0umiI> were also seen for  some subsets \nsubdivided by gender  (restricted to two age ranges, to equate the number of stimuli), as shown in Figure \n4, low er row. V alues of symI were again qui te close to zer o (usually 0.1>\u2212 ), indica ting strong \nconsistency with a sym metric dis -similarity.  Values of addtreeI\u2032  were similar to the a priori  value, but \nmuch large r than for the surrogates. As was  the case for  the texture  experiment, these result s were \ninsensitive to the pa rameters a and h of the prior f or the distribution of choice probabiliti es. Here , \nvalues of t he Dirichlet parameter  a obtain ed by maximum l ikelihood ranged from approximately 0.1 to Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n39 0.5; results similar to tho se of Fi gure 4 were ob tained wi th setting 0.3a=  for a ll datasets. Also a s was \nthe case for the tex ture experim ent, findings f or symI and addtreeI\u2032 , were not substant ially changed when h \nwas det ermin ed by maximum like lihood \u2013 even t hough the  typical value s of h were larger  (medi an, \n26 10\u2212\u00d7 ), supporting  the idea that man y underlying choice probabili ties were close to 0.5.  \nBrightness  \nThe \u201cbrightness\u201d experiment  consisted of judgments of brightness  dis-similarity for the set of \ndisk- and-annulus s timuli  as shown in  Fi gure 5A. This disk- and-annulus configuration has been \nextensively used to study the effect of the context surround on the a ppearance  of the inner disk \n(Gilchris t, 2006; Wallach, 1948) . A light surround is expected to have make the inner disk appear \ndarker, and convers ely, darker surround is expected to make th e inner disk appear lighter . While it is \ngenerally assumed that this shift in appearance  is along a one -dimensional brightness continuum , the \nevidence is ambiguous (Murray, 2021) . For example , Madigan and Brainard (Madiga n & Brainard, \n2014)  found that one dimension suffices t o explain brightness similarity  ratings , while Logvinenko & \nMaloney (Logvinenko & Maloney, 2006)  found that dissimilarity rating s under different illuminations \nrequired a 2 -dimensional perceptual space.  \nThis open question motivated the stimuli used in the present experiment:  a gamut of 8 disk \nluminances, presented with eith er of 2 surround context s (Figure 5A ). Participants judged the brightness \nof the inner disk for triplets constructed from all possible combinations of disk luminance and surround \n(Figure 5B) . If brightness is one dimensional, then di s-similarity judgment s for the f ull set of stimuli \nshould be consistent wit h a one-dimensional model, w hich is  a special case of an addtree model . If, on \nthe other hand, the surround produces differences in appearance that are no t one di mensional, then the \nfull set of judgment s should be  inconsistent with addtree. Under this hypothesis, restricting the \njudgments t o stimuli with the  same surround ( the subsets encircled by the dark and light blue lines in Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n40 Figure 5A ) should recover a one-dimensional struct ure and consistency with  an addtree model, while \nrestriction to a same -sized set but with two kinds of surrounds (green lines in Figure 5A) should remain \ninconsistent .  \nFigure 5C shows the results . For t he full sti mulus set (black symbols), addtreeI\u2032 is close to zero (> -\n0.17),  and substantially higher than the a priori  value, for all three participants.  E ven higher indices are \nfound for the  8-element stimulus subsets of only black (addtreeI\u2032 > 0.09) or only white (addtreeI\u2032 > 0.05) \nsurrounds (blue symbol s in Figure 5C).  This is consist ent with the notion that, when context is held \nconsta nt, dis- similarity judgments are highly consistent with a one-di mensional space. However, when \naddtreeI\u2032  was computed for 8- element subse ts of the stimuli in which judgments were made across two \nsurrounds (green sy mbols in  Fi gure 5C), addtreeI\u2032  was lower, and varied substantially across participants. \nGA always the lowe st value (addtreeI\u2032  -0.26 to -0.17) and JP the highest value close to zero (addtreeI\u2032 -0.08 to \n-0.03).  \nThese findings show that when the surround context is constant, judgments are highly consiste nt \nwith an addtree mod el, but there is inter- observer variability when judgments are made across two \nsurround contexts . The variability is not surp rising, as previous research has shown that individual \nidiosyncrasies can play a substan tial role when disk -in-context stimuli are used to study brightness or \ncolor (Radonjic, Cottaris, & Brainard, 2015). Our method seems to be capturing these inter -individual \ndifferences , but \u2013 as we a re focusing on a demonstration  of the anal ysis methods \u2013 we do not attempt to \nprobe t he basis fo r this  difference here.  \nSimilar to the texture and faces experimen ts, values of symI are all close to zero for the brightness \ndataset, indica ting consistency with symmetric dis -similarity  judgments . Ultrametric indice s umiI are Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n41 below the a priori  value for all cases, indicating inconsistency with an ultrametric model , as expected \nfor a one -dime nsional continuum.  \nAlso as in the texture and faces experiment s, results were robust to changes of analysis details. \nValues of the Dirichlet parameter aobtained by maximum likelihood ranged from  appro ximately 0.07 to \n0.22; results similar to tho se of Fi gure 5C were ob tained wi th sett ing 0.1a=  for a ll datasets . Findings \nfor symI and addtreeI\u2032  were not substant ially changed when h was det ermined by maximum like lihood, \nyielding values of h with a medi an of 25 10\u2212\u00d7 , comparable to the faces data set.  \n \n Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n42  \n \nDiscussi on \nThe main c ontribution of the paper is to ad vanc e a strategy for connec ting similarity  judgments \nof a collection of stimuli to inf erences about  the structure of th e domain from which the stimuli are \ndrawn. The starting point is a n experi mental dataset in w hich the ju dgments are assumed to be \nindependen tly drawn binary samplin gs distributed accord ing to the underlying choice probabilitie s. We \nassume  that for each triad  (a reference stim ulus and two com parison stim uli), the compariso n stimu lus \nthat is more often judged to  be more similar to the ref erence is at a shorter distance f rom it, but w e do \nnot a ssume, or attempt to infer, a  relationship betwee n choice probabilities  and the distanc es. This \napproach also takes int o account the possibil ity th at each triad may have its  own \u201c local\u201d transformat ion \nthat lin ks choice probabi lity an d distance . While we reco gnize that judgments m ay be uncertain, we \nrefrain from postulating a noise  model or a  decision model  \u2013 or even that sensory or decis ion noi se is \nuniform throu ghout the spa ce.  \nDespite t he paucity of assump tions, we show that it is possible to c haracterize dis -similari ty \njudgments along three lines : consistency with symmetry, con sistency wi th an ultra metric model, a nd \nconsistency with an addit ive tre e model.  These characteri stics are functi onally si gnificant a spects of a \ndomain \u2019s org anization. Symme try (or its absence) has implications for the mechanis m(s) by which \ncomparisons are made (Tversky, 1977;  Tversky & Gati, 19 82). For symmetric  similarity judgme nts, \naddtree models , but no t ultrametric models, are consistent  with the Tver sky cont rast mo del (Sattath & \nTversky, 1977) . More  broadly, semantic do mains are antic ipated to be consisten t with a h ierarchical \nmodel of similarity  judgments (ultrametric o r addtree), whil e domains  of feature s are not (Kemp & \nTenenbaum , 2008; Saxe et al., 2019) . It is also wo rth noti ng that one -dime nsional domains are a special \ncase of the addtree model, so the present approach can a ddress whet her th e apparen t \u201ccurvatur e\u201d in a Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n43 one-dimensional perceptual  space can be  eliminated  by alte rnative c hoices of the linkage  between  \ndistance and  decision  \u2013 a limit ation of the analysis in (Bujack, Te ti, Miller, Caffrey, & Turton, 2022) . \nFurtherm ore, our method is sensitive enough to reveal inter -individual differences : for some participants \ndata are consisten t the addtree mo del and f or others , not (or less so)  \u2013 consistent with other studies of the \ninfluence of context  (Radonjic et al., 2015) , and an interesting area for furth er investig ation . \n \nComparisons to  other  meth ods \nThe present strategy, whose overriding consideration is to keep  assumpt ions at a min imum, is \ncomplemen tary to other ways of an alyzing similarity judgments. A classical and co mmonly- used \napproach, non -metric m ultidimensi onal scaling  (de Leeuw & H eiser, 1982; Ts ogo et al., 2000) , \nexplicitly postu lates that th e original data (h ere, the choice pr obabil ities)  reflect a monotoni c \ntransforma tion of a metric di stance. The distance is taken to  be the  Euclidean  dista nce, but distanc es in a \nhype rbolic or s pherical geomet ry can also be used.  An important related approa ch for one-dimensiona l \nmodels is maxi mum -likelihood difference scal ing (Knoblauch & Malone y, 2008;  Malo ney &  Yang, \n2003) , which\u2013 via a decis ion model \u2013 takes into acco unt the noisy nature of psychophysic al judgme nts. \nThis approach can also be extended to multidimensional mod els, but the need f or a decision model \nremains  (Victor  et al., 2 017; W araich  & Victor, 2022) . \nOur appro ach also contrasts with that of topologic al da ta analys is via persi stent homologies  \n(Dabaghian et al., 2012; Giusti et al., 2015; Singh et al ., 2008;  Zhou e t al., 2018) . Like  our approach , \nTDA avoids the need to pos tulate a specifi c relationship bet ween dis -similarities  and distan ces, as the \nBetti numbers are calculated from a sequence o f graphs that depend only on the  rank order of similarity \njudgmen ts. However, cons truction of this  sequen ce of graphs  does re quire  a global ly uniform linkage \nbetween triadic jud gments and re lative d istance, and also, that every pairwise  distanc e is include d in the Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n44 measured triads. The ch aracterizations yielded by TDA ar ea also complemen tary: they focus  on \ndimensionalit y and homology cl ass, rather than the characteri zations consi dered he re.  \nFinally, we note another a pproach that directly seeks to identify features of ultrametric behavior \nin ne ural data. T reves (Treves, 1997)  developed an information -theor etic measure of dis -similarity of \nneural responses to faces . The strat egy for seeking evidence of ultrametric behavior  was to examine t he \nratio, with in each trip let, of t he mi ddle distan ce to the l argest. This ratio , which would be 1 for an \nultrametri c, was found in that study to be clo ser to  1 than for expected by chance.  Nonparametric \ngeneralizations of this approach may permit a relaxation of  the assumed  linkage b etween  extensions the \ninformation-theore tic measure and dis- similarity, an d even an eva luation of a ddtree models \u2013 but in \ncontra st to our approach, i t begins wi th a set of re sponses to each stimulus, rather than a sam pling of \ntriadic co mparisons.  \nCaveats  \nKeeping assum ptions  to a minimum nece ssarily leads to certain  limitations.  The indices  for \nsymme try and addtree structure  reflect necessary , but not sufficient, c onditions. M oreover, these i ndices \ndo not measure the goodness  of fi t of a model , and are not  directl y applicable to mode l comparis ons: the \nindices merely measure to wha t extent the data act  to concentrate the a priori  distribution  of choice \nprobabilit ies into t he subset of choice probabilities that ha ve a particular chara cteristic. Thus, it is \nimportant to recognize that  the extent of co ncentration will depend on the typical  coverage  of each triad: \na greater number of trials of each triad will data p rovides bette r estimates of the underlying choice \nprobabilities, and thus, can mo ve the ind ices fu rther f rom their  a priori  values. For this reason , the \nexamples above (axes v s. vees in Fi gure 3; subdivision by age vs. gender in Fi gure 4, same context vs. \ndifferent c ontexts in Figure 5C) focus on compariso ns of indice s betw een datasets with a sim ilar number \nof sti muli, and a similar coverage of each.   Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n45 Extensions and open issues  \nThere are open questions  that are ra ised by the pr esent approa ch, as well as some directions in \nwhich it might be ex tended. \nAt a pra ctical le vel, if the present  analysis ind icate s that a dat aset is consistent wit h an \nultrame tric or addtree model, to wha t extent  can the ult rametric or addtree structure be  dete rmined ? \nExisting metho ds for taking thi s step  require a comple te set of dis -similarity  mea sures  (Abraham, Bartal, \n& Ne iman, 2015; Ba rth\u00e9lemy & Gu\u00e9noche, 1991; Hornik, 2005; Sattath & Tversky, 1977) , along with \nthe assump tion that the transformation  from triadi c choice probabil ities into dis -similarit ies is uniform \nacross the space.  Choice probabilit ies pro vide constraints even without thi s assumption \u2013 for example  \ncertain rel ationships among th e triadic judgmen ts involving four points are  sufficient for a  loca l addtree \nmodel \u2013 bu t it is unclear w hether th ese constraints are sufficient for a global mo del, or how such a global \nmodel  can be d etermin ed.  \nThe observation tha t a metric that obeys the fou r-point condit ion can always be realized by the \npath metric  on a weighted acycli c graph (Buneman, 1974)  suggests t he possibility of a succession of  \nfurther  characteriz ations  of a set of choice probabilities. By def inition, a cyclic graph s have no thre e-\ncycles. An isolated  3-cycle with nodes 1a, 2a, and 3acan always be removed by adding a node c, with \ndistances ( )1 12 13 23( ,) (, ) (, ) (, ) / 2dca da a da a da a= +\u2212 , etc.; this quantit y is guaranteed t o be non-\nnegative via t he triangle inequality, and 1 2 12(, ) (, ) ( , )dca dca da a+= .  Thus , ruling out  the four -point \ncondit ion on distances via the  condition ( 4.5) impl ies that the dis -similarity structu re cannot be realized \non a weighted acyclic grap h, or on a weighted graph with onl y isolated thr ee-cycles.  Consequently, a \ngraph with two non-disjoint three -cycles or  a four -cycle, is requir ed. Sim ilarly, mo re elab orate \nconditions analogous to (4.5) then rule out realiz ing the dis -similarities on graphs  with less than so me \nspecified  level of cy cle structure. For  example , if the conditions ( 4.5) hold for two qua druplets with Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM  \n46 three po ints in common, then the four -cycles requir ed by each c onfiguration m ust have  three p oints in \ncomm on, so a five -cycle, or tw o linked four -cycles,  or mu ltiple edge -sharin g three-cycles, are r equired  \nto be present i n a graph that accoun ts for the  dis-similarities amon g the five points.  \n In this regar d, it is int eresting to note that the ultra metric c ondition and the four -point condition \nhave a  simila r structure: both s tate that of three numbers (three  single distance s for the ultrametric , three \npairwise sums for th e four -point condition) , the largest two must be  identical. This intrig uing si milarity \nraises the fu rther possi bility of a sequence of anal ogous c onditions, each specifying  a progressively less -\nrestrictive aspect of a set of dis-similarity judgments  \u2013 such  as compatibility  with planar  graphs, or \nstatement s about the Betti num bers.  \n Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n47  \nAppendi x 1: Metric spaces  \nThis appendix demonstra tes that cons istency  of a se t of cho ice probabil ities with  a symmetri c \ndis-similarity  implies consistency wi th a met ric-space struct ure.  \nA metric space is de fined to be a set of point s { , , ,...}xyz , along wit h a dis tance (, )dxy  that \nassociates  each pair of points, and that satisfies  three propert ies: \n (, ) 0 (, ) 0d x y and d x y x y\uf0b3 \uf03d\uf0db\uf03d , (6.1) \n : (, ) (,) symmetry d x y d y x \uf03d , (6.2) \nand \n : (, ) (,) (,) the triangle inequality d x y d x z d y z \uf0a3\uf02b . (6.3) \nAs we have gene rically assumed (in eq.

(6.4) \nSince our cen tral assumpti on is that the ra nk-order of dis- similarities acco unts for wheth er a \nchoice probability is l ess than  or gre ater than 1\n2 (eq. (1.5), which is (6.4) wi th D instead of d), eq. \n(6.4) will hold wh en the distance d is any monotonic tr ansform ation  of the d is-similarity D: \n \uf028 \uf029 (, ) (, )dxy FDxy\uf03d . (6.5) \nSo it suffic es to fin d a monotonic transformatio n for which  (, )dxy  satisfies  the triangl e inequality.  \nA suitable transfor mation for this purpose i s  Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n48  0, 0\n()1 ,01u\nFu uuu\uf0ec \uf03d \uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf03d\uf0ed\uf0ef\uf02b\uf03e\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf02b\uf0ee.

Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n51  \nAppendix  3: Local S ufficiency  for t he Four-Point Con dition   \n \nHere, we sh ow th at fal sificatio n of the conjunction (4.5) suffi ces to ensure t hat the dis -\nsimilarities are co nsistent w ith a local  addtree model. More precisely , we show that if, for each \nrelabelin g of a set of four points, (4.5) does not hold, then there is a monot onic transf ormation \n(, ) ( (, ) )dxy FDxy=  of the di s-similarities  into dist ances, for which th e four-po int condition (4.1) holds. \nWe will al ways choose F to be of the form \n 0\n0,(),D kk DFDDD D\uf0ec\uf02b\uf0b3\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf03d\uf0ed\uf0ef\uf03c\uf0ef\uf0ee. (8.1) \nso th e demonstration re sts on  finding an appropriate cho ice of 0D and k We note that we  can ignore \nwhether the quantity tha t results f rom the monot onic transfo rmation sati sfies the  triangle ine quality , \nsince Ap pendix 2 shows tha t the four-point condition i mplies the t riangle inequality. \nWe refer to the th ree qu antities in  the four-po int conditio n (4.1) and t he corr esponding sums of \npairs o f dis- simila rities as \u201cpa irsums. \u201d We at  first assu me that all  dis-similarities are uneq ual, and \nconside r the case of equality below. \nGiven that the dis- simil arities ar e unequal , we relabel th e points so that (,)Dzc  is the gre atest \ndis-s imila rity. If (,) (,)Dzc Dab\uf02b  is not the largest  pairsu m, we  choose 0 (,) D Dzc=  in (9.1). With this \nchoice, (,) (,) (,) (,)d zc dab Dzc Dab k+=++ , but the other pairs ums are unc hanged. Sett ing k equal to \nthe differen ce between  (,) (,)Dzc Dab\uf02b  and the next-l argest pairsu m yields a transforma tion to \ndistances that sa tisfies the fo ur-point condi tion. \nSo w e only need to consider ca ses w here (,)Dzc  is the large st dis-simila rity and \n(,) (,)Dzc Dab\uf02b  is the large st pairsum. In each case , we ta ke 0 (,) D Dab>  but smaller than t he next-Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n52 large st disparity . This  increases (,) (,)Dzc Dab\uf02b  by k. We show t hat this transformation increases at \nleast one of the other two pai rsums by  at least  2k, enab ling one of the other two pairsums to \u201cc atch up \u201d \nto (,) (,)Dzc Dab\uf02b . To do t his, we  need  to show that for at least  one of the other tw o pai rsums, both \nterms are greater than (,)Dab . \nGiven tha t (,)Dzc  is the lar gest dis-similarity, t he second-l argest  dis-similarity  cannot be \n(,)Dab , since then (4.5) would hold. So  the second-largest  dis-similarit y must share a point with the \nlargest dis-si milarity , and we can label the point s so th at this secon d-largest dis- similarity is (, )Dza . \n(,)Dab  cannot be t he third -largest  dis-similarit y, since then all o f (4.5) would hold. Thu s, we m ay \nassum e tha t (,)Dzc is the largest  dis-si milarity, (, )Dza  is the second- largest, an d we consid er the three \npossi bilities for the third -largest dis-similarity, (,)Dzb , (,)Dac , and (,)Dbc , in turn ( Figure 6). \n If the t hird-largest  dis-similarity is (,)Dzb : Either (,) (,)Dac Dab\uf03e  or (,) (,)Dbc Dab\uf03e , since \notherwise (4.5) would hold. Thus, both t erms  of at least on e of (,) (,)Dzb Dac\uf02b  or (, ) (,)Dza Dbc\uf02b  \nare great er than (,)Dab .  \nIf the third -largest dis-similar ity is (,)Dac : (,)Dab  cannot be l arger tha n both (,)Dzb  and \n(,)Dbc , bec ause then, a conjunction like (4.5) would hold wi th b at the vertex  (we wou ld have (,)Dab  \nthe largest  of the tent at b, and (,)Dzc  the largest of the b ase.) So  at le ast one of (,) (,)Dzb Dab\uf03e  or \n(,) (,)Dbc Dab\uf03e . Thus, both te rms of eit her pa irsum (,) (,)Dzb Dac\uf02b  or (, ) (,)Dza Dbc\uf02b  are gre ater \nthan (,)Dab .  \nWe now exten d the above argume nt to the case in  whic h the conjunction (4.5) is false after \nallowing s ome of the d is-similarities to be eq ual (but these equaliti es involve at most  one of th e two  \ncomponents of a pai rsum, as speci fied fol lowing eq. (4.5) ). We n eed to show that under these \ncircumstances, there is still a monot onic distort ion of th e dis-similarities into distances for wh ich the Ordinal Ch aracterizati on of Similarity J udgments  \n10/09/23 10:42 AM \n53 four-point condition holds. Assum e otherwi se \u2013 i.e., that there is a \u201crogue\u201d co nfigurat ion of dis-\nsimilarities Q that does not a llow for such a monotonic di stortion. If there i s such a ro gue configuration  \nQ, we c an find, for sufficiently small \uf065, another configu ration Q\uf065 with unique d is-similarities , whose \ndis-similaritie s within \uf065 of Q at the tie s, and equal to  the dis-similarities in  Q at the non- ties. The \nabove co nstruction yields a mon otonic distortion  (,) ( (,) )d uv F D uv\uf065 \uf065\uf065\uf03d  that convert s the dis-s imilarities \nin Q\u03b5 to distances that satisfy the four -point cond ition. \n Now ap ply the limit of these monotoni c transformations, 0 lim F\uf065\uf065\uf0ae  to the dis- similarities in  Q. \n(This limit must ex ist, and the convergenc e is uniform: if , two configura tions 1Q and 2Q have dis-\nsimilarities that match  to within an amount q, then the monotonic functions needed for 1Q and 2Q will \ndiffer by a t most q). In this  limit, the four-point cond itions must hold, since they ar e simple linear \nfunctions of t he distances, that hold for all suff iciently small 0\u03b5>. That F is mono tonic follows from \nthe monotoni city of each F\u03b5, and the uniform convergence of F\u03b5 to F.
